        <h1>EU chief: Time to ‘think about mandatory vaccination’</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:36:47+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:36</time>

    <p><strong>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged countries within the European Union to “think about” mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations for citizens, as the bloc prepares a “common approach” against the pandemic.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a news conference, the European Commission chief suggested that member states should move towards compulsory vaccination to help prevent the spread of cases and a further spike in infections due to the emergence of new variants, such as the Omicron strain.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think it is understandable and appropriate to lead this discussion now, how we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union,&rdquo;</em> von der Leyen stated, adding that fighting the pandemic requires a <em>&ldquo;common approach&rdquo;</em> across the bloc.</p>

    </ul>


<p>The EU doesn&rsquo;t have the power to force countries to implement vaccine mandates but it can work with member states to reach an agreement on a combined way to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Currently, around 77% of adults&nbsp;in the bloc have been vaccinated, with the European Commission president calling on nations to proceed with inoculation programs and the rollout of booster shots to help protect citizens from new strains. Despite the overall progress made, vaccination rates vary significantly across member states, with some&nbsp;drastically trailing behind their fellow EU countries.</p>

        <h1>‘We cannot understand’: Sudden death of taekwondo champion, 19, branded a mystery</h1>

    <p><strong>The shocked coach of a tragic taekwondo starlet who won European gold less than a month ago says there is no obvious cause of her death at the age of 19, with messages of support arriving from across Russia.</strong></p>
    <p>Perm University prodigy&nbsp;Arina Biktimirova is said to have suddenly died at home in the city where she studied on Monday, leaving her parents mourning their only child.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;news comes just weeks after&nbsp;Biktimirova became champion at the European Taekwon-Do ITF Championships in Crete.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We cannot understand what could have happened to her health,"</em> Biktimirova's coach, Daniel Gorbunov, told <a href="https://www.perm.kp.ru/daily/28363/4511434/?utm_source=yxsport&amp;utm_medium=desktop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KP.RU</a>.</p>

<p><em>"Arina did not have any chronic diseases. Before each competition, athletes are not just checked, but literally 'shine through'.</em></p>
<p><em>"Arina, when she was checked before going to the European Championship, was completely healthy. What has happened [has made] us too shocked."</em></p>
<p>According to the outlet, Biktimirova's relatives said she had been fine and did not report feeling unwell when she recently spent a day off at home.</p>
<p>Her parents are said to have been woken by her wheezing and losing consciousness the following morning.</p>

    </ul>


<p>An ambulance rushed to try to save Biktimirova, but doctors could not revive the athlete who&nbsp;began her sporting exploits at the age of six.</p>
<p>Biktimirova&nbsp;was studying to become a&nbsp;radiophysicist&nbsp;at the university alongside her high sporting ambitions.</p>
<p>Her university trainers described her death as <em>"a huge loss"</em> and said they had received calls <em>"from all over Russia"&nbsp;</em>expressing condolences.</p>
<p><em>"At 11, she had already begun to represent the Russian national team,"</em> they pointed out.</p>
<p><em>"She was a real girl-star &ndash; not only in sports, but also in music and studies. She chose a non-standard profession for herself... and dreamed of becoming a radiophysicist.</em></p>
<p><em>"In sports, she was a talented athlete who had a great future ahead of her. If Arina performed at competitions,&nbsp;it meant that she automatically reserved a medal for herself."</em></p>

        <h1>AUKUS aimed at China, US confirms</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:53:05+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:53</time>

    <p><strong>America’s Asia security head has admitted that the AUKUS pact, which includes the sale of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, was created to counter China in the Indo-Pacific.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking on Wednesday, Kurt Campbell, the US coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs on the National Security Council, told an audience at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based international policy think tank, that AUKUS was more about taking a stand against China, than technology sharing.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541858-putin-demands-nato-deal/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The AUKUS partnership<em> &ldquo;is both a clear anxiety about what we&rsquo;ve seen in terms of certain actions and policies on the part of China, but it is also a determination that no, we have a role in our future and we&rsquo;re going to stand up,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Campbell contended that AUKUS, a partnership between the UK, US and Australia, was a <em>&ldquo;defining effort&rdquo;</em> against China by all the countries involved, noting that he was <em>&ldquo;extraordinarily proud of the achievement.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The security expert contended that China&rsquo;s actions in the region are provocative, while its <em>&ldquo;economic warfare&rdquo;</em> against Australia has reunited the former allies when just seven or eight years ago, the UK, US, and Australia were falling apart.</p>
<p>Beijing has attempted <em>&ldquo;to drive Australia to its knees and then find a way forward,&rdquo;</em> Campbell stated, claiming that Sino-Australian relations will eventually improve over time. China will respect Canberra&rsquo;s resilience and will <em>&ldquo;re-engage on Australian terms,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>The AUKUS nations had not previously admitted that the agreement sought to counter Chinese assertiveness in the region. Despite China&rsquo;s grievances, diplomatic efforts and media attention had focused on France&rsquo;s anger that the AUKUS deal saw Canberra cancel a diesel-electric submarine deal with French shipbuilder Naval Group.</p>
<p>China has warned that the agreement will prompt an arms race in the region, which is already fractured by territorial disputes. It also claims that the sharing of nuclear submarine technology is against international conventions of nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>Beijing&rsquo;s relations with Australia spiraled downwards last year after Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an independent review into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Shortly afterwards, China raised tariffs on Australian goods, including barley.</p>

        <h1>Putin calls on NATO to do a deal</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:14:08+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:14</time>

    <p><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will request talks with NATO to ensure that the US-led military bloc does not creep closer to his country's borders, as Ukraine moves to allow Western troops into the country.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking to a group of newly-arrived ambassadors in the Kremlin on Wednesday, Putin said that his country will <em>&ldquo;insist on guarantees being set out to exclude the possibility of NATO moving any further to the east, and deploying threatening weapons close to Russian territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I would like to emphasize that we need these to be legal guarantees,&rdquo;</em> the Russian president said, <em>&ldquo;given that our Western colleagues have not fulfilled their respective oral obligations.&nbsp;Everyone knows they made promises they wouldn't expand eastwards, but then they did the opposite. Legitimate Russian security concerns have been ignored and continue to be ignored.&rdquo;</em></p>

    </ul>


<p>Putin insisted that <em>&ldquo;the threat at our Western borders is really growing, and we have repeatedly talked about it. It is enough to see how close NATO&rsquo;s military infrastructure has advanced to the Russian borders. It's more than serious for us.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to him, the Kremlin is taking steps to secure the country&rsquo;s frontiers, but the president insisted that Russia poses no threat to the West. <em>&ldquo;To shift the blame, as we say, from those who are sick in the head onto those of us who are healthy is irresponsible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s remarks come amid heightened tensions between the US-led military bloc and Russia over its increased presence in Eastern Europe. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov revealed that <em>&ldquo;significant units and armaments from NATO countries, including American and British, are being moved closer to our borders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He also blasted what he described as the West&rsquo;s long-term goal of pushing anti-Russian ventures onto other states, noting that the incorporation of former Soviet republics into the bloc is<em> &ldquo;the brightest example of this.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a recent interview with CNN, NATO&rsquo;s chief Jens Stoltenberg said that the bloc had beefed up the size of its forces threefold and upped its presence in both the Black Sea and Baltic Sea to counter Russia&rsquo;s presence. A US Navy-guided missile destroyer the &lsquo;Arleigh Burke&rsquo; was deployed to the Black Sea last week not long after two other American warships sailed through the same waters.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned that Stoltenberg&rsquo;s plans to shuttle American nuclear warheads around Eastern European nations due to supposed threats posed by Moscow&rsquo;s alleged<em> &ldquo;aggressive actions&rdquo;</em> endangered existing peace accords between the two parties.</p>
<p>Putin has previously insisted that his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, was given assurances by Western leaders that NATO would not expand into the space left after the fall of the USSR. Then, in 2017, a tranche of documents was declassified, and widely interpreted as showing that American, British, and German officials gave assurances to the Kremlin in the 1990s that NATO would not push into Eastern European nations, before then admitting countries like Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</p>
<p>The purported dishonesty was cited by Putin as a strategic threat in 2014, when announcing that the country would reabsorb the Crimean Peninsula. <em>&ldquo;When the infrastructure of a military bloc is moving toward our borders, it causes us some concerns and questions. We need to take some steps in response,&rdquo;</em> he said at the time.</p>

        <h1>World Bank offers its green guidance to Russia</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:49:14+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:49</time>

    <p><strong>The World Bank (WB) has suggested Russia introduce a carbon tax in industries with high greenhouse gas emissions, including the fuel and energy sector, to reach carbon neutrality goals.</strong></p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>Putting a price on carbon is the bedrock for the broader range of climate policy instruments. Carbon pricing can take a number of forms &ndash; usually as a tax or a tradeable permit system</em>,&rdquo; the WB said in its report on the Russian economy published on Wednesday.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541787-plan-green-energy-superpower/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>It specified that &ldquo;<em>making polluters pay for the prevention of costs they impose on society</em>&rdquo; would help gain resources that can be used to accelerate Russia&rsquo;s green transition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Energy, transport and major industrial plants are some of the most common sectors to have carbon pricing applied... Including these emissions in carbon pricing would cover 79% of emissions in Russia</em>,&rdquo; the report noted.</p>
<p>While the organization suggests Russia focus on carbon pricing by setting a tax or a fee-based permit system, it also mentions alternatives such as a greenhouse gas emissions trading system (GHG). This is based on the &lsquo;cap and trade&rsquo; system, in which the authorities set an aggregate emission limit for a number of polluting sites, which is then divided into quotas and distributed among them. Another alternative is introducing emissions-based energy taxes, or energy excise taxes, which, the WB notes, are currently very low in Russia by international standards.</p>
<p>In August, Moscow announced it would set up a number of working groups to oversee the country&rsquo;s transition to green energy, with a focus on renewables and environmental protection, and a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. Despite coming under fire for setting a target so far off &ndash; a decade after many other nations &ndash; Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that the country is doing its part to reduce emissions.</p>

<p>The WB report stresses, however, that in order to achieve this goal, Russian authorities must &ldquo;take concrete actions of moving towards decarbonization&rdquo; in the nearest future.</p>

        <h1>Russia sets out position on mandatory vaccinations</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T11:46:17+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 11:46</time>

    <p><strong>Russia has ruled out the possibility of slapping fines on people who refuse vaccination against Covid-19, despite regions across the country passing directives requiring elderly and vulnerable citizens to sign up for jabs.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov was asked whether those who refused to comply would be handed financial penalties. <em>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t permit such measures to be taken in Russia,&rdquo;</em> he answered.</p>
<p>On Monday, local media in Austria reported that the country was considering implementing mandatory vaccination beginning in February 2022. A draft of the plan showed that residents of Austria who refuse vaccination would face fines up to &euro;3,600, or four months imprisonment if they failed to pay. People who repeatedly refused orders to get vaccinated could be fined up to &euro;7,200.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">

    </ul>


<p>Russia registered record numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths in November. Although domestic-made vaccines have been available since last year, less than half of the population has gotten a jab. The government has encouraged people to get vaccinated, and the Ministry of Health has warned that those who have been immunized make up only 0.03% of serious Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>Speaking to RBK business daily on Wednesday, Timofey Nestik, a researcher at the Institute of Psychology in the Russian Academy of Sciences, hit out at a scheme to give anti-vaccine activists tours of hospital wards. According to him, the tours, a number of which have already been carried out as part of a media opportunity, were ineffective because they only brought attention to the anti-vaxxers&rsquo; beliefs.</p>
<p>Nestik recommended that Moscow guarantee people won&rsquo;t get sick from the vaccine, and use the media to share positive and encouraging stories about vaccination. The scientist added that Covid-19 is not going away, and that the conversation should <em>&ldquo;shift the focus from how soon one person needs to get vaccinated, to how we&rsquo;re going to live as things go on.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia is considering implementing a nationwide QR-code system that would restrict access to public areas and transport based on vaccination status. However, polls show that nearly half the population opposes the use of vaccine passports in this way.</p>
<p>In Moscow, workers in a number of public-facing industries including transport and hospitality have been ordered to sign up for jabs or face being sent home without pay. Other regions have introduced &lsquo;mandatory&rsquo; vaccination for the elderly and infirm, but it is unclear what the penalty would be for those who refuse.</p>

    <p><strong>Five men from the Russian republic of Mari El have been detained by the police after they were caught pretending to be women on online dating websites and stealing $40,000 from potential Chinese suitors.</strong></p>
    <p>According to the Interior Ministry, the five men created profiles online and corresponded with foreigners, posing as Russian girls. When the victims sent money to the<em> &ldquo;girls,&rdquo;</em> the communication instantly stopped.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The lengthy internet conversation eventually got to the point when the gentlemen expressed their desire to invite the interlocutor to their country, to get married and live together,&rdquo;</em> Police Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Ignatyev explained. <em>&ldquo;At the same time, the gentlemen agreed to pay for travel and other expenses. After the money was received, communication with the victims was terminated.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The men were detained in Cheboksary, a city around 500 kilometers east of Moscow. According to the police, three identified victims were men between 42 and 56 years old living in the cities of Wuhan, Xining, and Ganzhou. In total, the Russians stole about three million rubles ($40,000) from them.</p>
<p>The police discovered the scam after law enforcement operatives came to check an apartment for usage of illegal substances. Once inside, they saw a scene resembling a call center with multiple laptops, mobile phones, and bank cards. The investigative team then discovered that it was rented by five residents of Mari El, who used the apartment to extort money from foreigners.</p>
<p>All five of the men have been charged with fraud.</p>

    <p><strong>A whistleblower has revealed the FBI has been targeting parents critical of the curriculum in schools. This shocking overreach of power by authorities threatens the freedom of all Americans.</strong></p>
    <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has gone on some wild goose chases in its time &ndash; from pursuing imaginary communists in Hollywood under the McCarthy era, to searching for proof that the Kremlin put Donald Trump in the White House. None of these flights of fancy, however, have been crazier than agents tracking suburban moms and dads, all for the &lsquo;crime&rsquo; of being increasingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eog_UDtpaVs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal</a> at school board meetings across the country.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. The G-men have been activated to track parents who&rsquo;ve had the audacity to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech ever since public schools started looking more like indoctrination camps than educational facilities. Not long ago, parents could rest at ease knowing their children were receiving a wholesome education by instructors who checked their political beliefs at the door of the schoolhouse. Those days have taken a long recess.</p>
<p>Today, parents are struggling to wrap their brains around the fact that their kids are receiving an ideological brainwashing on wildly misinformed ideas, like Critical Race Theory, which teaches, in a nutshell, that all white people (the very people, by the way, who supported passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965) are natural-born racists. And then there&rsquo;s transgenderism, which preaches that the easily observable biological classification of &lsquo;male&rsquo; and &lsquo;female&rsquo; are mere figments of the imagination; every person, the theory goes, is able to determine their &lsquo;true&rsquo; gender identity, of which there are <a href="https://dudeasks.com/how-many-genders-are-there-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> to be over 100 varieties.&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/540447-gay-black-conservaties-speak-up/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Should anyone apologize that many parents are vociferously opposed to their children being educated on such unconventional subjects? This mounting frustration has turned once monotonous school board meetings into electrically charged shouting matches.</p>
<p>In response to this outpouring of public criticism, did school officials show some humility and rethink the curriculum being taught in the classroom? Did they consider the possibility that the views of the parents just might deserve some consideration? Dream on; ideologues rarely admit they are wrong. What happened instead is that the National School Boards Association <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/school-officials-beg-biden-and-fbi-for-protection-against-threats-from-angry-mobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called on</a> the Biden administration to protect teachers and schools from the threat of &ndash; are you ready for it &ndash; &ldquo;domestic terrorism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked to testify before the House Judiciary Committee last month over the reckless rhetoric, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that he &ldquo;could not imagine any circumstance&rdquo; under which parents complaining about their children&rsquo;s education would be &ldquo;labeled as domestic terrorism.&rdquo; It appears that either Garland lied to Congress, or he is grossly unaware of madness happening on his watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, an anonymous FBI whistleblower released an email from early October, showing that the FBI&rsquo;s counterterrorism and criminal divisions created a &ldquo;threat tag&rdquo; to &ldquo;track instances of related threats&hellip; against school board administrators, board members, teachers, and staff.&rdquo; To say that sends a chilling message to all Americans, who simply wish to have a say over what their children are learning, would be an understatement. But it gets worse.</p>

<p>In the very same week that the FBI email was made public, Jann-Michael Greenburg, the president of the Scottsdale Unified School District board, was allegedly <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/540224-cops-probe-school-board-dossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> to have access to a dossier on school parents who had criticized the board and protested mask mandates. The file, which made a brief appearance online, contained the social security numbers, divorce records, financial data, Facebook comments, and photos of children of the targeted parents.</p>
<p>This sort of Stasi mentality makes one wonder what strange virus has contaminated the American mind? At what point in history, aside from our current cancel culture dark ages, has a meeting between parents and teachers &ndash; no matter how testy it got &ndash; ever been identified as a potential terrorism risk? Do these fragile wallflowers forget that democracy was never intended to be pretty? In fact, only a fool would be surprised if it occasionally resembles two fat guys mud-wrestling at the carnival fairground. Each individual has a unique way of looking at the world, so raw emotions will naturally rise on occasion. And here is where the situation takes on dark connotations.</p>
    <figure class="op-interactive">
        
                    <div class="media__youtube">        <iframe class="media__youtube-frame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKNwQoNiJWk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>            </figure>


<p>The very fact that some parts of society are accusing others of being the equivalent of Timothy McVeigh for not wanting &lsquo;White Fragility&rsquo; on the reading list does not bode well for the future of American democracy, nevermind school board meetings. Worse, it shows exactly how unrepentant and entrenched the left has become in its thinking, and I use the word 'thinking' loosely.</p>
<p>These &lsquo;Cultural Marxists&rsquo;, as these radicals have been called, view the political opposition not as fellow citizens worthy of debate and possibly even compromise. Rather, they see the other half of America as an enemy that must be identified, vilified, and liquified. These dedicated ideologues will do anything they can, even if it means enlisting the FBI, to impose their weird, cultural experiments on everyone, including schoolchildren. The only good news is that a whistleblower inside the agency spilled the beans, meaning there is still hope. Not everyone has been brainwashed by the radical progressive creed that would go so far as to deny parents the freedom of speech.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Beijing slams Australia over ‘delusional miscalculation’</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:20:27+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:20</time>

    <p><strong>China has called out Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton over an “irresponsible” assessment of its foreign policy, after a speech in which he questioned if a potential takeover of Taiwan would be enough to “satisfy” Beijing.</strong></p>
    <p>During a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian specifically referred to Dutton&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo;</em> remarks and criticized him for <em>&ldquo;brazenly [distorting]&rdquo;</em> China&rsquo;s efforts to <em>&ldquo;safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In his address at Canberra&rsquo;s National Press Club on Friday, Dutton had warned that the current strategic atmosphere in the region had <em>&ldquo;echoes of the 1930s&rdquo;</em> &ndash; seemingly referring to the tensions ahead of WWII.</p>
<p>Claiming that Beijing viewed other nations in the area as <em>&ldquo;tributary states,&rdquo;</em> he suggested that Taiwan &ndash; which China has long claimed as part of its territory &ndash; would only be the first domino to fall. He raised the specter of a potential Chinese takeover of the Senkaku Islands, which are the focus of a territorial dispute with Japan.</p>
<p>Referencing the speech, described as <em>&ldquo;hawkish&rdquo;</em> by the media, Zhao accused Dutton of <em>&ldquo;[misleading] the Australian people on the regional situation and priorities&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;[inciting] conflict and division between countries and peoples.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The remarks run counter to the trend of peace, development, and co-operation in our world today and are detrimental to regional peace and stability.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

    </ul>


<p>Zhao criticized Dutton&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;delusional miscalculation on China&rsquo;s foreign policy&rdquo;</em> and warned that <em>&ldquo;certain Australian politicians&rdquo;</em> should <em>&ldquo;stop hyping up the &lsquo;China threat&rsquo; narrative for selfish political gain.&rdquo;</em> He added that Australia was going down <em>&ldquo;the wrong path towards the point of no return.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While Dutton maintained that the region was <em>&ldquo;not on an inevitable path to conflict,&rdquo;</em> he said a policy of <em>&ldquo;acquiescence or appeasement&rdquo;</em> was <em>&ldquo;worse.&rdquo;</em> He pledged to <em>&ldquo;do everything I can&rdquo;</em> to <em>&ldquo;deter [China] from a position of strength, not weakness&rdquo;</em> if Beijing <em>&ldquo;takes a path other than peace.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In recent months, there have been rising tensions between the two countries due to a range of issues, including Taiwan, a bitter trade dispute over coal exports, and Canberra&rsquo;s trilateral AUKUS defense pact with the US and UK, which will see Australia obtain at least eight nuclear-powered submarines.</p>

        <h1>Russia tells US embassy staff to leave Moscow</h1>

    <p><strong>American embassy workers who have been stationed in Moscow for over three years have been given just weeks to leave the country, Russia’s Foreign Ministry has announced, amid a growing row with Washington over diplomatic visas.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, diplomatic spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced that <em>&ldquo;by January 31, 2022, employees of the US embassy in Moscow who have been on assignment for more than three years must leave Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The news comes after Washington reportedly denied extending the visas of dozens of family members of Russian diplomats based in the US. According to Zakharova, <em>&ldquo;we consider the American move to be a clear expulsion and intend to react accordingly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>She said that <em>&ldquo;such a game&rdquo;</em> was started by America&rsquo;s policy decisions, rather than because Russia was eager to break off ties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We tried long and hard to reason with them and direct them to some constructive solution to the issue, but they made their choice.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Moscow would retaliate over the impasse. The two states have been embroiled in a long-standing spat over the number of diplomats that can be stationed in both countries.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden revealed last month that the amount of American staff in Russia had dwindled to 120 from 1,200 in early 2017, and said it was hard to continue operations there when limited to just a<em> &ldquo;caretaker presence.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Washington has also ordered the closure of its consulates across the world&rsquo;s largest country.Earlier this year, citing limits on hiring local staff, the US Embassy in Moscow stopped processing non-diplomatic visas and listed Russians as <em>&ldquo;homeless nationalities,&rdquo;</em> essentially forcing immigrant visa applicants to travel to third countries, such as Poland.</p>
<p>Russia, however, has questioned why the US representative offices require so many employees to process consular documents.</p>
<p>Zakharova also blasted the move, remarking that US diplomats <em>&ldquo;have turned a technical procedure, a routine one for the 21st century, into a real hell,&rdquo;</em> and said American envoys <em>&ldquo;have for many years been destroying the system of consular services in Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Biden in June for their first bilateral summit since the US leader took office and later discussed normalizing embassy services. Moscow&rsquo;s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, however, said the talks proved fruitless due to American attempts to pressure the Kremlin into agreeing to terms set out by the White House.</p>

    <p><strong>A 24-year-old canoeist who won medals on the world stage and was honored in Ukraine has died just two weeks after being diagnosed with Covid-19.</strong></p>
    <p>The Canoe Federation of Ukraine announced the death of ten-time world and European medalist Bizu&nbsp;Borislav shortly after he tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The stricken star had systemic lupus erythematosus &ndash; a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease &ndash; and developed sepsis in hospital, an extreme response from his body to his Covid infection.</p>
<p>His&nbsp;mother's details were made publicly available to&nbsp;mourners keen to financially support&nbsp;Bizu's family.</p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">
            <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fukr.canoe%2Fposts%2F2702684946700078&show_text=false&width=500" width="500" height="498" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
        </figure>
    

<p>Borislav was introduced to the sport in 2008, winning medals at the Ukrainian Youth Championship in Kovel in 2010 and taking bronze at the European Junior Championship in 2014.</p>
<p>Known as 'Bory', he was coached by revered Russian Edem Muradasilov, who won three sprint medals at the World Championships in 1981 and 1982.</p>
<p>Muradasilov guided Borislav to three bronze, one silver and six bronze honors at world and European level.</p>

    </ul>



<p>That represented a better youth record than&nbsp;legendary canoeist Yuriy Cheban, the 2012 and 2016 Olympic champion who was also Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Borislav became a three-time champion at the&nbsp;European Junior Championship in 2015 &ndash; the same year&nbsp;he was made a&nbsp;Master of Sports of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;made a successful senior debut when he went to the World Cup in Portugal in 2016.</p>

<p>His hopes of competing at the Olympic Games were halted when he was diagnozed with lupus, a disease which is rare in men and characterized by the&nbsp;immune system attacking its own tissues and organs.</p>
<p>Since then, he has occasionally appeared at championships in Ukraine and worked as a coach.</p>
<p><em>"We would like to express sincere condolences to his family and friends,"</em> announced Canoe Europe following&nbsp;Borislav's death in Odessa. <em>"Rest in peace."</em></p>

    <p><strong>The oil and gas industry worldwide faces a talent gap as workers contemplate moving to renewables or leaving the energy industry altogether, a survey by recruitment firm Brunel and Oilandgasjobsearch.com, cited by Reuters, showed.</strong></p>
    <p>More than half of workers in oil and gas, 56%, said they would look for employment opportunities in the renewables energy sector, according to the survey. Last year, that percentage was 38.8%, highlighting the shortages the oil industry is facing as it looks to hire again, after letting go in 2020 thousands of workers in oil and gas and related services in the supply chain.</p>
<p>The survey also showed that 43% of workers want out of the energy sector within the next five years.</p>

    </ul>


<p>As more workers look to move to renewables or to ditch the energy sector altogether, recruiters in the oil and gas business find attracting talent with the right skills increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Labor shortages have already become evident this year in the US shale patch and in the Canadian oil sands as demand recovers and companies put rigs back into operation.</p>
<p>Despite the recent uptick in oil industry employment in the United States, short-term and permanent shifts in workers&rsquo; negative perceptions of the sector have already <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-US-Oil-Industry-Is-Facing-A-Talent-Crunch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to create</a>&nbsp;labor shortages. These shortages threaten to delay and even hinder the recovery of US oil production, analysts say. More and more workers are fed up with the boom-and-bust nature of the oil industry after two major oil price and drilling activity collapses in just five years. They vow they will never again be beholden to the volatile oil markets, and have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/ex-fracker-at-walmart-reveals-one-risk-to-u-s-oil-supply-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quit the sector</a>&nbsp;entirely after being let go in 2020.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of total jobs expected is set to rise next year, but labor constraints have already started to impact the members of the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors (CAOEC), the association <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Canadas-Drilling-Activity-Set-To-Exceed-2019-Levels-Next-Year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> last week in an otherwise positive outlook on Canada&rsquo;s drilling activity for 2022.</p>

        <h1>Antivax founder of major Christian TV network dies of Covid-19</h1>

    <p><strong>The prominent televangelist and founder of vaccine-skeptical Daystar Television Network, Marcus Lamb, has died of coronavirus complications.</strong></p>
    <p>His death was announced by the network, which describes itself as one of the two largest Christian television broadcasters in the world, on November 30.</p>
<p>A week before Lamb&rsquo;s death his wife Joni confirmed that he had been hospitalized with Covid pneumonia, with their son Jonathan citing a &ldquo;<em>spiritual attack from the enemy</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>As much as my parents have gone on here to kind of inform everyone about everything going on to the pandemic and some of the ways to treat Covid &ndash; there&rsquo;s no doubt that the enemy is not happy about that</em>,&rdquo; Jonathan Lamb said during the broadcast on November 23.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/535704-covid-dutch-court-minor-antivax-dad/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Diabetes made the 64-year-old unvaccinated father of three especially vulnerable to the disease.</p>
<p>Texas-based Daystar, founded by Lamb in the early 1980s and reaching 2 billion viewers, campaigned against lockdowns, vaccination, and vaccine mandates throughout the pandemic, with numerous programs &ldquo;<em>exposing truths</em>&rdquo; about vaccines and featuring a number of well-known &lsquo;Covid-dissidents,&rsquo; including Robert Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit Daystar filed together with the American Family Association, the vaccine mandate was labeled as a &ldquo;<em>sin against God&rsquo;s Holy Word</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news about Lamb&rsquo;s death was followed by a stream of condolences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Marcus is now in the presence of His Lord and Savior. He had preached about heaven, taught about heaven, and now he is experiencing heaven</em>,&rdquo; the president of Samaritan&rsquo;s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Franklin Graham, wrote on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>A damning investigation in Sweden has found that doctors are ignoring the physical harm and irreversible damage caused by giving puberty blockers to primary school children diagnosed with gender dysphoria.</strong></p>
    <p>Wherever you stand on trans issues, no one could fail to be shocked by the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/20211125/leading-swedish-hospital-accused-of-injuring-gender-dysphoric-children-with-hormone-treatment-1091006921.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revelations</a> coming out of Sweden about the life-changing injuries and harmful side effects inflicted on children by cavalier doctors at the Karolinska University Hospital, all in the name of the great gender debate.</p>
<p>The youngsters treated at the Stockholm hospital had all been diagnosed with gender dysphoria &ndash; the unshakeable feeling that their physical characteristics were mismatched with how they felt about their gender &ndash; and were subsequently injected with regular doses of oestrogen, testosterone or other hormones to effect a physical transition to their new identity.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria, it must be pointed out, is not a physical affliction in any way. It is all in the head.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/541447-book-trans-gender-debate/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Now, some of those children treated at the hospital are showing signs of osteoporosis, reduced bone density, liver damage, massive weight gain &ndash; one child piled on 25kg in just one year &ndash; and severe mental health issues. Some of those transitioning to male have changed their minds and want to identify as female again, but are stuck with the irreversible characteristic of a deep voice, thanks to testosterone injections, according to an <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/uppdrag-granskning-avslojar-flera-barn-har-fatt-skador-i-transvarden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">investigation</a> by the country&rsquo;s national broadcaster SVT.</p>
<p>This is Dr. Frankenstein territory. How can the supposedly super-progressive liberals of Sweden allow this to happen? What&rsquo;s even more outrageous is that in the case of one 11-year-old in the programme, the treatment continued for three months after doctors were alerted to skeletal deformation.</p>
<p>These are just kids who have been treated like lab rats. Tweenies and even younger who are crying out for help with their mental health, not hormone injections. It&rsquo;s mind-boggling to think that a child still in primary school can be making life-altering decisions that will put them on a one-way transitioning journey, yet they have not even experienced puberty. Their brains are not fully formed, they can&rsquo;t legally drink, smoke, vote or drive a car, yet they are being credited with a self-awareness far beyond their years.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.transgendertrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Steensma-2013_desistance-rates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> in the Journal of American Academy of Adolescent and Child Psychiatry revealed that around 80% of children grew out of gender dysphoria, although <a href="https://www.transgendertrend.com/children-change-minds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> for the UK&rsquo;s Tavistock Gender Identity Clinic found that those who began medical intervention were less likely to change their minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That still doesn&rsquo;t make a majority, however. So surely it makes sense that if the probability is that a child will change their mind about transitioning, then mental health support should be prioritised as the prime intervention, before harmful drugs are administered?</p>
<p>Where in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hippocratic-oath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hippocratic Oath</a> &ndash; &lsquo;primum non nocere&rsquo; (first, do no harm) &ndash; is the exception for this scandalous abuse? How can medical professionals treat children like this, so that distraught parents are left blaming themselves, with one Swedish mother heartbreakingly admitting, <em>&ldquo;Of course you feel anger towards those you trusted. But also towards myself; I am the one who will protect my child, but I have not done that in any way.&rdquo;?</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/540550-uk-greece-elgin-marbles-woke/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The SVT probe found that despite most medical professionals recommending that puberty blockers should not be prescribed for longer than two years, over the last five years, one in five children in what Swedish doctors call &lsquo;trans care&rsquo; has been given the hormones for three years. Talk about not reading the label.</p>
<p>One of the medical professionals involved, chief physician and pediatric endocrinologist Ricard Nergardh, admitted that administering puberty blockers was <em>&ldquo;chemical castration.&rdquo;</em> But, remarkably, it still didn&rsquo;t stop him or his colleagues from doling them out.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s all new. Gender dysphoria as a diagnosis has really only been on the radar since around 2013. But it&rsquo;s a boom time for the medical profession, with many who should know better reluctant to suggest to their younger patients that maybe this is &lsquo;just a stage&rsquo; they&rsquo;re going through, in case they attract unwanted attention from the increasingly vocal trans lobby.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s not just in Sweden that the pressure is on an increasingly compliant medical profession to imperil the mental and physical wellbeing of our children, while playing along with a wrongheaded critical theory on gender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions will be raised in Sweden, no doubt, but they also need to be raised in the UK, the US, Canada and Australia, where gender transition has become the cause du jour. Before any more children are irreversibly damaged.</p>

    <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo has been criticized after replying to a rant from a fan account on social media which blasted the perceived injustice of the Portugal star not winning the Ballon d'Or.</strong></p>
    <p>Lionel Messi was handed the France Football gong for a record seventh time in Paris on Monday night, putting him two ahead of the Manchester United forward in their generational rivalry.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony, Ronaldo had gone off on a rant of his own by attacking a journalist who had suggested that his main aim was finishing with more editions of the award than the Argentine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Pascal Ferre lied, he used my name to promote himself and to promote the publication he works for,"</em> said Ronaldo on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"It is unacceptable that the person responsible for awarding such a prestigious prize could lie in this way, in absolute disrespect for someone who has always respected France Football and the Ballon d&rsquo;Or."</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere on the social network, where Ronaldo boasts 372 million followers, he came across a post from a fan account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pointing out that Ronaldo won the Coppa Italia and Super Cup with Juventus in 2021, it added that he had finished top scorer in both Serie A and at the Euros.</p>
<p>Offering that Ronaldo <em>"performs miracles"</em> and <em>"is the guy who impresses the world most often"</em>, the account asked:&nbsp;<em>"Do you really think five guys [did] more than him [this] year? Never."</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, in a dig at Messi, it claimed that Ronaldo's real competitor for the award was Robert Lewandowksi, who despite netting 64 goals in the calendar year was poor for Poland, who he captains, at the Euros.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;Messi scoring the most goals and being named the player of the tournament at the Copa America, it was suggested that the achievement of finally winning the South American showpiece should be overlooked as the star number 10 did not net in the semifinal or final.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"For Cristiano to win it, he has to be 300 percent unquestionable,"</em> it was protested.</p>
<p><em>"Those who are intelligent enough know. Receiving awards without deserving it is false happiness, without pride. Regardless of those awards, CR7 will always be the best in history."</em></p>

<p>Popping up in the comments section, Ronaldo replied with a simple <em>"factos" (facts), </em>plus a thumbs up and eyes emoji,&nbsp;after also liking the post.</p>
<p><em>"I actually can&rsquo;t believe this is a 36-year-old athlete. The lack of sportsmanship and the inferiority complex is despicable,"</em> scoffed one critic.</p>
<p><em>"Just two days ago Ronaldo posted this essay on IG,"</em> it was also said, highlighting his rant against the reporter.</p>

<p>When an illustration was made as to the stellar year Messi had in 2018 but still didn't win to Ronaldo, a reply pointed out that there were <em>"no&nbsp;family members complaining on the internet,"</em>&nbsp;as Ronaldo's sister Katia Aveiro does when her sibling misses out on something or is attacked.</p>
<p><em>"Not a word from Messi. Messi didn&rsquo;t put anyone down, even though he was utterly disrespected. He kept his head up and played so well that they had no excuse but to give him the award the next year. Not that he cared. Mentality."</em></p>
<p>The row is just the latest installment of endless arguments between the toxic fanbases that are Messi and Ronaldo obsessives online.</p>
<p>Even after the men well into their mid-30s have hung up their boots, it seems fanboys will continue taking potshots at each other and either player until their dying breath.</p>

        <h1>What happens if Europe runs out of gas?</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T11:42:54+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 11:42</time>

    <p><strong>The real test of Europe's energy supply is here. As temperatures have started dropping on the continent in recent days, power prices spiked again, and the natural gas shortage could worsen in case the winter is colder than usual.</strong></p>
    <p>There isn't an immediate fix to the power and natural gas supply crunch, and the colder and longer the winter is, the worse the situation could become, analysts say. Currently, the only thing that could ease the pressure on tight energy supply in Europe is demand destruction in industries due to high natural gas prices, some note. &nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/541723-finland-electricity-price-spike/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Some have even said that gas stores could fall to zero this winter if cold weather abounds.</p>
<p>Russia is fulfilling its contractual obligations with customers to send natural gas to Europe via pipelines, but it has not significantly raised additional supply amid the gas and energy crunch in recent months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the controversial Russia-led Nord Stream 2 project hit a snag earlier this month after Germany said it had&nbsp;<a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Germany-Suspends-Nord-Stream-2-Certification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suspended</a>&nbsp;the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The Federal Network Agency of Germany, Bundesnetzagentur,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2021/20211116_NOS2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>&nbsp;in mid-November that it suspended the procedure to certify Nord Stream 2 AG as an independent transmission operator until an operator of the pipeline in Germany is incorporated under German law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setback delays by at least a few weeks the earliest possible in-service date for the pipeline, which could potentially alleviate gas shortages in case of a colder winter in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With uncertainty about the start date of Nord Stream 2, European gas and power prices could exceed the record highs they had reached in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"I wouldn't rule out a return to the record highs of October if you look at how short the market is and limited Russian flows,"</em> Wayne Bryan, an analyst at Refinitiv, said last week, as quoted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/living-hand-mouth-europes-gas-crunch-shows-little-sign-easing-2021-11-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"If the weather gets cold in Europe there's not going to be an easy supply solution, it's going to need a demand solution,"</em> Adam Lewis, a partner at trading house Hartree Partners, told <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/europe-s-energy-crisis-is-about-to-get-worse-as-winter-arrives-1.1688121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Some energy-intensive industries using a lot of natural gas&mdash;including ammonia, fertilizer, and steelworks&mdash;have curtailed operations in Europe in recent months as record natural gas prices made their production unprofitable.&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/541614-nord-stream2-gas-pipeline-delay/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Demand could drop if more industries reduce operations in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For consumers, apart from soaring gas and electricity prices, the natural gas crunch could mean rolling power outages if the winter is really cold, Jeremy Weir, CEO at one of the largest commodity traders, Trafigura, warned earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Market-Could-Be-Worth-As-Much-As-16-Trillion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></strong><em>"We haven't got enough gas at the moment, quite frankly. We're not storing for the winter period,"</em> Weir <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a06df5b2-58ff-46f2-920d-a5ebaca68b11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> at the FT Commodities Asia Summit in the middle of November.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"So hence there is a real concern&thinsp;that&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;if we have a cold winter that we could have rolling blackouts in Europe,"</em> Trafigura's chief executive said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The natural gas crunch is pushing power prices in Europe to record or near record highs. A very cold and still winter weather with low wind speeds would further exacerbate the power supply shortage, especially in north Europe, which relies on wind generation for part of its electricity supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, lower wind power generation in France, coupled with lower nuclear power supply, sent French day-ahead power prices last week to <a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/french-power-trades-at-9-year-high-as-cold-weather-boosts-demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the highest in nearly a decade</a> as demand rose with the arrival of colder weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day-ahead power prices in the Nordic region for Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cold-snap-lifts-nordic-power-price-monday-record-high-2021-11-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped to a record high</a> on the Nord Pool exchange, as the low temperatures combined with lower power supply from renewables and high gas prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With tight natural gas supply and uncertainty whether and when Russian gas flows could be significantly raised, Europe's power and gas systems and markets are facing the toughest test yet this winter season.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Protesters in Sudan were met with tear gas as they marched in the country’s capital Khartoum on Tuesday. They told RT they want the nation to return to full civilian rule after the military seized power in October.</strong></p>
    <p>Security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters that chanted <em>&ldquo;Soldiers belong in the barracks,&rdquo;</em> demanding the return to full civilian authority.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These are all young voices protesting against this government. They want a civilian government,&rdquo;</em> a man attending the rally told RT&rsquo;s Murad Gazdiev.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/540559-sudan-killed-rallies-wounded/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Another man claimed that security forces <em>&ldquo;kill people,&rdquo;</em> who want <em>&ldquo;peace [and] justice.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Reuters cited Sudanese media as saying that some protesters tried to cross security barriers, and 44 people were arrested, including 18 minors, who were returned to their families.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Sudanese army overthrew Omar al-Bashir, the country&rsquo;s leader of more than 25 years. The military staged another coup last October, ousting civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.</p>
<p>Hamdok was reinstated as PM on November 21 after signing a power-sharing deal with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who led a coup against him. Hamdok agreed to form a technocratic interim government that will function until the elections, scheduled for July 2023. Al-Burhan, who now serves as the chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, promised not to run for political office during the 2023 vote.</p>
<p>Several large-scale rallies have been held in Khartoum and other cities since the October coup. Protesters insist that Hamdok has betrayed the will of the people by cooperating with the coup leader.</p>
<p>Pro-military protests were also held before the coup, with attendees calling on the army to dissolve the government.</p>
<p>Hamdok said his cabinet will focus on completing <em>&ldquo;the transition to democracy,&rdquo;</em> and prepare the country for elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, at least 43 people have been killed since the protests began.</p>

    <p><strong>The England national team manager has questioned the value of mismatches to the development of the women's sport after her side hammered Latvia 20-0 in a World Cup Qualifier.</strong></p>
    <p>Four player bagged hat-tricks&nbsp;in the mauling at&nbsp;the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster, with Lauren Hemp leading the way with four goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chelsea's Bethany England scored twice among no fewer than 10 goalscorers in total throughout the massacre.</p>

<p>Replying to a post by a reporter, a fan said that he wasn't enjoying the action and pointed out that even <em>"at their weakest"</em>, England's heaviest defeat was 8-0.</p>
<p><em>"This is very silly &ndash; 10 mins left and it could be 20-0,"</em>&nbsp;they correctly predicted&nbsp;as the score increased.</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;of the scorn was in response to a viral clip of Latvia 'keeper Laura Sinutkina delivering a poor goal kick.</p>
<p>Despite her trying to hit the ball forward,&nbsp;the effort flew out for a goal-kick not far from the penalty area.</p>

        <h1>World’s most expensive city named, and it’s a shocker</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T11:11:17+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 11:11</time>

    <p><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel has won the unenviable title of world’s most expensive city to live in, according to a newly released biannual report by the Economist Intelligence Unit.</strong></p>
    <p>The city jumped to the top of the list, from fifth place last year, for the first time ever, the EIU&rsquo;s December 2021 worldwide cost of living index, released on Tuesday, shows.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/541595-covid-global-tourism-losses/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>According to the EIU, Tel Aviv climbed up the rankings due to the rise in the Israeli currency, the shekel, &ldquo;<em>buoyed against the [US] dollar by Israel&rsquo;s successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout</em>,&rdquo; which was one of the quickest in the world. The Israeli shekel was up 4% against the US dollar year-to-date early last month, which prompted prices on nearly one-tenth of goods to surge. Food and transportation costs were hit the hardest.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s leader &ndash; Paris &ndash; slipped to second, closely followed by Singapore. Among other cities in the most expensive top 10 are, in succession, Zurich, Hong Kong, New York, Geneva, Copenhagen, Los Angeles, and Osaka. Rome dropped the furthest in the rankings, amid a decline in prices for food and clothing.</p>
<p>The fastest-rising city is the Iranian capital, Tehran, which jumped 50 places to number 29, amid shortages and price increases due to US sanctions. Damascus, Syria was ranked the least expensive city in the survey.</p>
<p>Overall, the EIU survey shows that supply-chain bottlenecks, changes in consumer demand, and swings in currency exchange rates over the past year have increased the cost of living in many of the world&rsquo;s largest cities, and analysts expect prices to rise further in the coming year. The largest increase was recorded in transportation, with the average price of gasoline per liter up by 21%.</p>
<p>Also, according to EIU figures, the inflation rate of the prices it tracked is currently the fastest recorded in the past five years, surging from 1.9% in 2020 to 3.5% year-on-year as of September 2021.</p>
<p>The EIU&rsquo;s survey assessed the cost of living across 173 global cities and compared the prices of over 200 everyday products and services.</p>

        <h1>Russia planning to swap gas for hydrogen exports as EU goes green</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T09:17:58+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 09:17</time>

    <p><strong>With much of Europe setting its sights on renewable energy and weaning themselves off fossil fuels, Moscow has unveiled a new proposal to save its status as a major exporter of fuel across the continent for the future.</strong></p>
    <p>The plan, set out in a statement on the Kremlin&rsquo;s website on Tuesday, comes as part of a larger overview of Russia&rsquo;s environment policy, with a new strategy to tackle climate change unveiled just weeks ago.</p>
<p>Under the provisions, a project will be launched to study the possibility of exporting clean-burning hydrogen, mixed with methane, through the country&rsquo;s already-built gas pipelines. This would mean large volumes could be shipped without needing to construct new infrastructure.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/531117-russian-economy-green-energy-transition/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Alexander Novak, the deputy prime minister and former minister of energy, will work with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and with Alexey Miller, the head of energy giant Gazprom, to test the pipelines&rsquo; capability and negotiate with European nations. The Kremlin has requested a report detailing whether the scheme is possible by the middle of 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5100299"></a></p>
<p>The value of Russia&rsquo;s fuel and energy exports was $167 billion last year, down from $263 billion in 2019, with the country increasingly gaining revenue from sectors like manufacturing and services. Crude oil accounts for the largest share of this, followed by petroleum products and gas. Moscow is the world&rsquo;s leading exporter of gas and the second largest exporter of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1029431/russia-fuel-and-energy-export-value-by-source/"></a></p>
<p>Nations have been increasingly looking to &lsquo;green&rsquo; hydrogen as a source of renewable energy. The gas can be used as a low-carbon power source for manufacturing and transportation, but is expensive to produce and difficult to transport. With demand expected to surge, exporters are racing to demonstrate it can be delivered safely and cheaply.</p>
<p>In August, Moscow said it would set up a series of working groups to oversee the country&rsquo;s transition to green energy, with a focus on renewables and environmental protection. However, Russia has come under fire for setting a carbon neutrality target for 2060, a decade after many other nations. However, President Vladimir Putin has insisted that the country is doing its part to reduce emissions.</p>

    <p><strong>Tokyo officials have asked the US military to investigate an incident in which an American fighter jet dropped a fuel tank that landed in a residential area. </strong></p>
    <p>Suspicious metal objects were found in the coastal town of Fukaura, with a population of some 7,600 people, earlier this week. The debris, which landed in the center of the town, was later confirmed to be parts of an F-16 fuel tank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Misawa Air Base in the north of Japan&rsquo;s main island of Honshu confirmed there was an emergency with a US Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon. According to the military, two external fuel tanks were dropped from the jet before it landed at Aomori International Airport. Officials from the base initially claimed the tanks fell in a nonresidential area.</p>

    </ul>


<p>The pilot wasn&rsquo;t injured, they said, but the plane remained on the airport&rsquo;s single runway for a while, disrupting commercial flights.</p>
<p>The Japanese Defense Ministry called on US forces to conduct a proper investigation into the incident, Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday. Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the US military had been issued a request to ground the fighter jets until they are confirmed safe for operation.</p>
<p>The governor of the Aomori prefecture, Shingo Mimura, said his government would also make &ldquo;<em>a serious protest</em>&rdquo; to the US military over the incident. &ldquo;<em>I am taking this very seriously, seeing as it involved a heavy volume of flammable fuel and the possibility of a major disaster</em>,&rdquo; he stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a meeting with the Fukaura mayor, a commander from the Misawa Air Base, Colonel Timothy Murthy, acknowledged that the tank &ldquo;<em>regrettably</em>&rdquo; landed in the town, saying, &ldquo;<em>We are very thankful that it didn&rsquo;t injure anyone</em>.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;<em>a very thorough investigation</em>&rdquo; had been launched.</p>
<p>Objects that were about 1 meter long (3.5 feet) were found by police near Fukaura town hall, and some 20 to 30 meters from residential houses, after scared locals reported smelling oil and hearing thunderous sounds. What was later identified as aviation fuel was reportedly splattered all over the road. The debris was confirmed to be bits of just one fuel tank, with the landing location of the other one still unknown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first fuel dumping incident by US fighter jets in the northeastern prefecture. Previously, F-16s dropped tanks into a lake and the sea, raising safety concerns among the locals.</p>

    <p><strong>Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has warned China that the invasion of Taiwan would be “economic suicide,” noting that Japan and the US would not stand by and let it happen.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking on Wednesday at a forum organized by Taiwanese think tank the Institute for National Policy Research, Abe said that an armed invasion of Taiwan would spell danger for Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-US alliance. People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should never have a misunderstanding in recognizing this,&rdquo;</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541844-australia-covid19-center-break/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The former prime minister added that Japan&rsquo;s Senkaku Islands, which China also claims, are a mere 100km (62 miles) or so away from Taiwan.</p>
<p>In a further warning to Beijing, Abe warned that Chinese adventurism could be the death knell for its economy. <em>&ldquo;A military adventure would be the path to economic suicide,&rdquo;</em> he said. <em>&ldquo;We must keep reiterating that peaceful ties between China and Taiwan are the only option.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>China responded on Wednesday, condemning Abe&rsquo;s remarks and registering its solemn representations through diplomatic channels at the comments made by the former Japanese leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beijing claims Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and it also has a long-running territorial dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands.</p>

    <p><strong>Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and therefore the US-led bloc cannot guarantee that it would fight on its behalf in case of Russian military "aggression," its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a press conference in Latvia, where he is visiting for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, the former Norwegian prime minister emphasized that Ukraine is just a partner and the terms of the bloc&rsquo;s agreement state that it goes to war to defend its own members.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We must understand the difference between a NATO ally, for example, Latvia, Poland, and Romania, and a close and highly valued partner [such as] Ukraine, for which we provide support, training capacity, equipment,&rdquo;</em> he explained, pointing out that there is no obligation for the bloc to protect Kiev.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541778-nato-shipping-weaponry-border/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Stoltenberg&rsquo;s comments come amid increasing fears over alleged military buildup on the Russia-Ukraine border. Suggestions of a possible armed conflict have been pushed by a number of Western media outlets, including America&rsquo;s CBS News, which reported that a military incursion is increasing in likelihood <em>&ldquo;as the weather gets colder.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Stoltenberg suggested that Moscow had arranged a <em>&ldquo;large and unusual concentration&rdquo;</em> of troops and equipment near the frontier, and warned that <em>&ldquo;any further provocation or aggressive actions&rdquo;</em> would be of serious concern.</p>
<p>All suggestions that Russia wants to invade Ukraine have been denied by the Kremlin, which has consistently stated that troop movements within Russian borders are no business of foreign countries.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The very allegations that Russia is going to attack someone, and accusations that Russia is somehow being aggressive, are completely groundless,&rdquo;</em> said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday.</p>

    <p>The &lsquo;2G-plus&rsquo; rules came into force in the German capital last Saturday, restricting access to most public venues to people vaccinated against Covid-19 and those who have recovered from the disease.</p>

    </ul>


<p>On Tuesday, the franchise Wonder Waffles posted an ad on its social media pages, announcing that it was offering free coffee to unvaccinated clients. A small-print text section added that the offer actually applied to to-go orders by all patrons regardless of their vaccination status.</p>
<p>The promotion was a gesture of concern over the 2G rules and how they meant that <em>&ldquo;we are no longer allowed to welcome so many regular guests,&rdquo;</em> the message said.</p>
<p>The ad landed Wonder Waffles right in the middle of heated debate in Germany over vaccine mandates and whether the authorities were overstepping their boundaries in the effort to get people vaccinated.</p>
<p>Apparently uncomfortable with the situation, the chain deleted the message and posted a new one on Wednesday, saying social media was not the right platform to have that debate. While the chain stands for freedom of expression, it didn&rsquo;t want its shops to be the target of review bombing, the statement said. The offer of free coffee for everyone remains in place till the end of December.</p>
    

<p>Another shop that inserted itself into the vaccine row is San Sebastian, located in Berlin&rsquo;s Charlottenburg area. It too offers free complimentary coffee to anyone who buys cakes, regardless of their vaccination status. According to the newspaper Tagesspiegel, customers reacted positively to the campaign, which the owner says was launched because people with differing opinions must not be marginalized.</p>

        <h1>OPEC says no to Joe</h1>

    <p><strong>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is not sticking with the planned oil production increase in November under the OPEC+ deal. This comes despite the calls from US President Joe Biden to boost oil output.</strong></p>
    <p>According to a Reuters survey published on Tuesday, the group&rsquo;s crude oil production rose by 220,000 barrels per day, 13% short of the boost that OPEC should be providing.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/541633-biden-blunder-sends-oil-higher/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Under the OPEC+ deal reached earlier this year, 10 OPEC member-states are to boost their combined production by 254,000 barrels per day each month, while the bloc&rsquo;s non-member allies, including Russia, are to contribute 146,000 barrels per day more. The total OPEC+ supply increase should reach a total of 400,000 barrels per day through next year, until oil production hits pre-Covid-19 pandemic figures.</p>
<p>However, according to the survey, some OPEC members don&rsquo;t have the capacity to produce more. While OPEC&rsquo;s major producers Saudi Arabia and Iraq complied with their production boost quota in November, Angola, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea failed to pump more oil. Angola&rsquo;s output slumped by 50,000 barrels per day, with exports dropping to record lows, according to tanker schedules.</p>
<p>OPEC+ is set to meet on Thursday to assess the market and decide on production levels for January, with analysts warning that the group could pause supply increases amid woes over the new Omicron Covid-variant effect on global oil demand. Also, experts say the recently announced strategic oil reserves release by the US and five other major oil consuming countries could force the group to cut production increases, as it could bring about a crude surplus early next year.</p>

<p>Oil prices rose more than 3% ahead of the OPEC+ meeting, recouping some of the heavy losses earlier this week. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose $3, or 4.4%, to above $72 a barrel at 09:00am GMT on Wednesday, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose $2.86, or 4.3%, to $69 a barrel.</p>

    <p><strong>Any aggression by Russia toward Ukraine could trigger “serious consequences,” and Moscow should think twice, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday in Latvia, where he’s attending a meeting of NATO foreign ministers.</strong></p>
    <p>Standing alongside Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs, Blinken slammed Russia as issuing <em>&ldquo;increasingly belligerent rhetoric&rdquo;</em> and alleged that the country was conducting <em>&ldquo;unusual troop movements&rdquo;</em> along Ukraine&rsquo;s border.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Any escalatory actions by Russia would be of great concern to the United States, as they would to Latvia, and any renewed aggression would trigger serious consequences,&rdquo;</em> Blinken told the press.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541829-ukraine-army-deployed-donbass/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The secretary of state&rsquo;s comments come amid reports from some Western media sources that Russia is planning to mount an invasion of Ukraine in the near future, with Moscow facing accusations that it is building up its military presence on the Russian-Ukrainian frontier.</p>
<p>Blinken noted that the meeting of NATO foreign ministers, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, would feature a discussion on what the bloc should do to strengthen its defense capabilities <em>&ldquo;in the context of concerns raised by Russia&rsquo;s actions along Ukraine borders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Also, on Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg clarified that Ukraine was a close partner, but as a non-member, the bloc would not guarantee its security, despite expressing concern over the alleged Russian military buildup.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We must understand the difference between a NATO ally, for example, Latvia, Poland, and Romania, and a close and highly valued partner [such as] Ukraine, for which we provide support, training capacity, equipment,&rdquo;</em> he explained, pointing out that there is no obligation for the bloc to protect Kiev.</p>

    <p><strong>Donald Trump claimed Meghan Markle is “disrespectful” to the British royal family, and reportedly accused her of “horribly” using her husband Prince Harry in an interview with ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage.</strong></p>
    <p>During the conversation in Florida, Trump told the Brexiteer that he had not been a <em>&ldquo;fan&rdquo;</em> of Markle since <em>&ldquo;day one.&rdquo;</em> A selection of the former US president&rsquo;s comments were released ahead of the scheduled airing of the sit-down on GB News on Wednesday.</p>
<p>These included his belief that Markle was being <em>&ldquo;very disrespectful to the royal family and most importantly to the Queen,&rdquo;</em> who he described as a <em>&ldquo;great woman, such a great person, a historic person.&rdquo;</em> Trump reportedly added that Harry will someday <em>&ldquo;regret&rdquo;</em> letting himself be <em>&ldquo;used horribly.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Later in the interview, Farage apparently remarked about Markle using stationery bearing her royal title as the Duchess of Sussex to lobby US Congress members on issues like paternity leave. In response, Trump noted that Markle is <em>&ldquo;trying to do things that I think are very inappropriate.&rdquo;</em></p>

    </ul>


<p>Trump&rsquo;s comments echoed those he has previously made about Harry and Markle, whom he branded as <em>&ldquo;nasty&rdquo;</em> in 2019. Meanwhile, Markle had called Trump <em>&ldquo;divisive&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;misogynistic&rdquo;</em> during the 2016 presidential campaign. The royal couple also urged voters to <em>&ldquo;reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity&rdquo;</em> in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>In response, Trump told reporters that he was not a <em>&ldquo;fan of hers&rdquo;</em> and wished Harry a <em>&ldquo;lot of luck... &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s going to need it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trump said he would campaign for the White House in 2024 after rumors surfaced about Markle <em>&ldquo;meeting with Democrat operatives&rdquo;</em> and weighing whether she would run for president.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I hope that happens because if that happened, then I think I&rsquo;d have an even stronger feeling towards running,&rdquo;</em> Trump told Fox News.</p>
<p>After the couple announced their high-profile move to the US last year, Trump had tweeted that <em>&ldquo;the US will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!&rdquo;</em></p>

        <h1>Gucci family reveal what they don’t like about Ridley Scott’s film</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T09:54:11+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 09:54</time>

    <p><strong>Descendants of Aldo Gucci have released a scathing statement condemning Ridley Scott’s new film, ‘House of Gucci’, for a “painful” portrayal that is an “insult to the legacy” of the fashion brand’s former chairman.</strong></p>
    <p>&lsquo;House of Gucci&rsquo;, released earlier this month, tells the story of the Italian fashion empire and Milan socialite Patrizia Reggiani&rsquo;s marriage into the family that ultimately ended in murder.</p>
<p>According to the statement, released to Italy&rsquo;s ANSA news agency, the family took particular offense at Scott&rsquo;s decision to portray Reggiani, who was convicted for arranging the assassination of Maurizio Gucci, as a <em>&ldquo;victim trying to survive&rdquo;</em> in a male-dominated world.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Gucci is a family that lives honoring the work of its ancestors, whose memory does not deserve to be disturbed to stage a spectacle that is untrue,&rdquo;</em> the statement declared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This is extremely painful from a human point of view and an insult to the legacy on which the brand is built today.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/541340-gucci-gaga-ridley-scott/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>While members of the Gucci family have not yet launched legal action against those behind the film, they were clear that they <em>&ldquo;reserve the right to take every initiative (necessary) to protect their name and image&rdquo;</em> of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga, who played Reggiani, previously accepted that her portrayal could be <em>&ldquo;painful&rdquo;</em> for the Gucci family, and refused to meet with the imprisoned socialite before filming over concerns she <em>&ldquo;wanted to be glorified&rdquo;</em> for the murder.</p>
<p>While Scott has not yet addressed the latest statement, he previously dismissed concerns raised by the fashion house that he was <em>&ldquo;stealing the identity of a family to make a profit.&rdquo;</em> Scott hit back against those claims on BBCs &lsquo;Today&rsquo; show, stating, <em>&ldquo;You have to remember that one Gucci was murdered and another went to jail for tax evasion, so you can&rsquo;t be talking to me about making a profit.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p><strong>Australian police have arrested three people who escaped a Covid-19 quarantine compound near Darwin in the Northern Territory. They had all tested negative the day before they broke out.</strong></p>
    <p>On Wednesday, police alleged that three people had scaled the perimeter fence of the compound in order to break out of the facility situated near Darwin in the Northern Territory. Police say the trio escaped Centre for National Resilience just before 4:40am.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    </ul>


<p>Officers had set up checkpoints and were inspecting cars in the area in an attempt to find the absconders. The three were swiftly caught and taken into custody.&nbsp;<br /><em>&ldquo;Police and staff at the Centre for National Resilience are currently confirming the absconder&rsquo;s identities prior to releasing further information,&rdquo;</em> authorities stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officials did not confirm whether the inmates were returning travelers or local citizens who had been put into quarantine. According to the BBC, the center has been used in recent days to house people infected with Covid-19 from an outbreak in Katherine, a town 300km (185 miles) away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Howard Springs site can hold up to 2,000 people; it is situated within an old mining camp which was turned into a quarantine center by the Australian government in August.</p>
<p>The three individuals arrested had tested negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fears of contagion were heightened after one person housed at the facility, having returned from South Africa, had tested positive for the highly mutated Omicron variant on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Friday, a 27-year-old man scaled the facility&rsquo;s perimeter fence and jumped into a waiting car. He was later arrested but tested negative for Covid-19.</p>

    <p><strong>Czech police have detained the chairman of the Belarusian Football Federation and his wife and look likely to deport the 'ally' of Alexander Lukashenko after he attempted to attend a botched women's World Cup qualifying game.</strong></p>
    <p>Belarusian Football Federation supremo Vladimir Bazanov was&nbsp;held&nbsp;by police who confirmed they had stopped the couple during a<em> "routine check"</em> in the&nbsp;Moravian-Silesian region in the north-east of the&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>Bazanov, who has been described as a 'supporter' and 'ally' of Belarusian president&nbsp;Lukashenko by reports, had earlier been threatened with deportation by Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulganek, who has publicly offered <em>"unequivocal"</em> backing to opposition parties in Belarus.</p>
<p><em>"This person was not granted a Czech entry visa,"</em> Kulganek was quoted as saying by <a href="https://denikn.cz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Denikn</a>, reportedly adding that&nbsp;Bazanov would not have entered the country by plane.</p>

<p>The official&nbsp;and his&nbsp;spouse are said to have stayed in the Czech city of Ostrava, and had visited a stadium in Opava where Belarus's women's side had been due to play before a coronavirus outbreak scuppered the game.</p>
<p>Pavla Yiroushkova, a spokeswoman for local police, said that <em>"two foreign citizens"</em> were arrested at their place of residence on suspicion of <em>"entering and staying in the Czech Republic in violation of the current protective measures defined by the Ministry of Health"</em>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Czech Republic was one of numerous countries to recall ambassadors following the disputed presidential elections in Belarus in October 2020, and suspended flights between the countries in May after an infamous air hijacking over Belarus in order to&nbsp;arrest an opposition journalist.</p>
<p>Czech president Milos Zeman last week offered his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, the immediate deployment of soldiers for 60 days to the country's&nbsp;border with Belarus, which has been at the center of a diplomatic crisis after hundreds of migrants tried to cross it.</p>
<p>The Embassy of Belarus in the Czech Republic has reportedly refrained from commenting on the development.</p>

<p>The qualifying game was postponed on Tuesday after three Belarusian players tested positive for Covid, forcing others to isolate because they were deemed close contacts of their infected teammates.</p>
<p>The federation said all of the visiting players, who are a point behind Belarus in fourth place in Group C, had tested&nbsp;negative upon their arrival.</p>
<p>The Netherlands&nbsp;top the&nbsp;table with 11 points, with nearest rivals Iceland trailing them by six points.</p>

    <p><strong>Ukraine has now stationed well over 100,000 troops and large quantities of hardware in the war-torn Donbass region, the Russian Foreign Ministry alleged on Wednesday morning, amid rising tensions.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, diplomatic spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that &ldquo;the Armed Forces of Ukraine are increasing [their] military force, pulling heavy equipment and personnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to some reports, the number of troops&hellip; in the conflict zone already reaches 125,000 people, and this, if anyone does not know, is half of the entire composition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine," she said.</p>
<p>Zakharova also condemned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for submitting a bill to the national parliament that would allow units from foreign armed forces to enter the country as part of multinational exercises next year.</p>
<p>According to her, such a move directly contradicts the Minsk agreement, signed in 2014 in a bid to end the fighting between Kiev&rsquo;s forces and troops loyal to two self-declared breakaway republics.</p>

    </ul>


<p>The broadside from the Russian Foreign Ministry comes amid concerns from the Kremlin surrounding the alleged deployment of American anti-tank missiles in the region close to Russia&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p>At the end of November, the head of Ukraine&rsquo;s military intelligence service, Kirill Budanov, said advanced US-made Javelin systems had been tested by Kiev&rsquo;s troops and had been deployed to Donbass.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that it was a concerning development that increased the prospect of a full-blown conflict in the region. <em>&ldquo;In recent weeks, we have seen a stream of consciousness from the Ukrainian leadership &ndash; especially when it comes to the military &ndash; that is excessively inflamed and dangerous,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>However, Lavrov&rsquo;s Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, denied all claims that his country&rsquo;s troops could soon launch an offensive there and said Kiev&rsquo;s officials were <em>&ldquo;committed to finding a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>He accused Russia of increasing <em>&ldquo;intensity of disinformation, including false accusations that Ukraine is supposedly preparing for a military attack in the Donbass.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Moscow insists that, in order to implement the Minsk agreement, Kiev must hold talks with the leaders of the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk regions.</p>
<p>However, Zelensky has refused to begin negotiations, insisting that the fighters are Russian-backed and calling on President Vladimir Putin to meet with him in the region instead.</p>
<p>The conflict in Eastern Ukraine began following the events of the 2014 Maidan, with the two self-declared Donbass republics announcing they would no longer recognize Kiev&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Neither Russia nor Ukraine officially recognize them, however, and both sides have said in public that a peaceful settlement to end the stand-off must be found.</p>

    <p><strong>Tesla’s new piece of merchandise linked to the widely anticipated all-electric Cybertruck, the Cyberwhistle, has sold out within two hours after CEO Elon Musk pitched it on Twitter.</strong></p>
    <p>The die-cast whistle designed to resemble Tesla&rsquo;s delayed electric pickup was launched for sale at $50 on the company&rsquo;s website on Tuesday.</p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">
            <iframe>
                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blow the whistle on Tesla!<a href="https://t.co/c86hLA0iQK">https://t.co/c86hLA0iQK</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465838829370228737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Musk shared the webpage link with his 65.1 million Twitter followers with a call to &ldquo;<em>Blow the whistle on Tesla.</em>&rdquo; Many viewed it as a nod to former Tesla employees who recently exposed working conditions at the company, which resulted in a number of lawsuits and smear campaigns.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541811-elon-musk-spacex-bankruptcy/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Musk&rsquo;s tweet produced the desired effect and propelled Cyberwhistle sales, with the product running out of stock within two hours of the post being published.</p>
<p>Later in the thread, Musk also made a lighthearted dig iPhone maker Apple, writing, &ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!</em>&rdquo; The $19 Apple Cloth for cleaning Apple devices has become hugely popular, causing backorder delays as long as 12 weeks at one point.</p>
<p>Tesla recently filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the &ldquo;<em>Cyberquad</em>&rdquo; name, with patents for an array of products, including toys, games, sports goods, and clothing. This may mean the company will release more products in line with the Cybertruck before Tesla launches production of its electric pickup next year.</p>
<p>The Cybertruck has already become somewhat of an icon, with toymakers Hot Wheels and Mattel recently launching a number of Cyber-inspired products.</p>

        <h1>‘Hidden motive’ prevents West from properly investigating Navalny case – Moscow</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T09:25:31+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 09:25</time>

    <p><strong>Western nations that have expressed “concern” over the alleged poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny are only really interested in undermining Russia’s International status, Moscow’s OPCW envoy told RT on Tuesday.</strong></p>
    <p>The <em>&ldquo;hidden motive&rdquo;</em> behind this whole case, which saw the German government and its allies accuse the country of using a potent military-grade poison in an attempt to murder the Western-backed activist, was always a <em>&ldquo;political one,&rdquo;</em> Alexander Shulgin, Russia&rsquo;s envoy to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), claimed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These states only sought to <em>&ldquo;push Russia back to the periphery of international politics&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;marginalize&rdquo;</em> its role within the international chemical weapons watchdog, Shulgin said, adding that they were by no means interested in clarifying the circumstances of this case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My personal opinion is that whatever answers we had given to our Western colleagues&hellip;they would have accepted none.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/538142-russia-opcw-navalny-poisoning/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Shulgin said that Moscow provided <em>&ldquo;extensive answers&rdquo;</em> to all the questions raised by a group of 45 <em>&ldquo;concerned&rdquo;</em> nations within the OPCW. These answers were based on the results of a large-scale investigation launched by Russian law enforcement in the wake of Navalny&rsquo;s alleged poisoning.</p>
<p>Moscow's probe saw <em>&ldquo;230 witnesses questioned, 64 biochemical analyses carried out and numerous items collected for comparative analysis.&rdquo;</em> The Russian specialists <em>&ldquo;found no traces of organophosphorus agents&rdquo;</em> in Navalny&rsquo;s samples, Shulgin said. Yet, all the answers were deemed <em>&ldquo;insufficient&rdquo;</em> by the West, he added.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s envoy to the chemical weapons watchdog also blasted all the accusations leveled against Moscow&nbsp;as <em>&ldquo;baseless,&rdquo;</em> adding that both the OPCW Technical Secretariat and NATO members concerned still failed to present any evidence to substantiate such claims.</p>
<p>It is Germany, France, and the UK that have demonstrated remarkable reluctance to cooperate with Russia in this probe since numerous requests for assistance filed by both Russia&rsquo;s Prosecutor General&rsquo;s Office and the embassy were simply left unanswered.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/536957-shulgin-opcw-navalny-novichok-us/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Germany, France, and Sweden as well as the OPCW itself also refused to share the formula of a chemical agent supposedly found by Western experts in Navalny&rsquo;s samples with the Russian investigators, Shulgin said. They also failed to answer other questions raised by Moscow, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The central question remains unanswered: how; under which circumstances traces of a chemical agent were found in Navalny&rsquo;s samples outside of the Russian territory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Navalny fell seriously ill in August 2020 and was flown to Germany for treatment after his life was saved in Russia. The German government and its allies later accused the Russian security services of poisoning him with a powerful chemical agent from the infamous &lsquo;Novichok&rsquo; group. Moscow denied the allegations.</p>
<p>The OPCW was called in to analyze blood samples taken from Navalny and confirmed the results of the German analysis. Moscow has questioned many elements of the Western investigation and says neither Berlin nor the OPCW provided reasonable answers.</p>

    <p><strong>A man from Houston, Texas was handed more than nine years in prison for fraudulently receiving over $1.6 million in pandemic relief money from the government and blowing it on a life of luxury and leisure.</strong></p>
    <p>Lee Price III was sentenced to 110 months in prison on Monday after pleading guilty to wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/520138-aristocrats-claim-job-retention/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>According to prosecutors, starting from May 2020, Price had been using fake companies to apply for low-interest loans under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The money was meant to help small businesses struggling during the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In an application submitted to a bank in Boston, Price claimed he owned a company called Price Enterprises with 50 employees and an average monthly payroll of $375,000. In an application to a California lender, he listed a dead man as the chief executive of a different company.</p>
<p>Price used the funds to buy a $233,000 Lamborghini Urus SUV, a $85,000 Ford F-350 pickup truck, and a $14,000 Rolex watch. He blew around $2,000 at a strip club, and spent large sums at liquor stores and nightclubs. The money also was used to pay off a loan on a residential property.</p>
<p>Police recovered around $700,000 of the funds Price received through PPP.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Mr. Price hopes that others will learn from his reckoning that there is no easy money,&rdquo;</em> Price&rsquo;s lawyer, Tom Berg, said in a statement to the media. <em>&ldquo;He has the balance of the 110-month sentence to reflect, repent and rebuild his misspent life.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p><strong>A virtual yacht non-fungible token (NFT) has been sold for an eye-popping $650,000, but that pales in comparison to the tens of millions paid for the opportunity to claim ownership of more expensive pieces of digital property.</strong></p>
    
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541721-boat-sold-metaverse-islands/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The Metaflower Super Mega Yacht was <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541721-boat-sold-metaverse-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> on November 23 to an anonymous donor known as 35D0CA for 149 ETH (Ethereum), roughly equivalent to $650,000. It has two helipads, an open-air swimming pool, and other luxurious facilities rendered in a low-polygon, crudely-textured 3D <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xa342f5d851e866e18ff98f351f2c6637f4478db5/69268721851518851203477350973661279010842020632441619262890672708376456069120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model</a>.</p>

<h2>NFWhat?</h2>
<p>The sale basically means that 35D0CA, whoever they are, is now listed as the virtual yacht owner in a distributed public database that&rsquo;s hard to tamper with. If offered a suitable amount, they can authorize a new entry to change the ownership status.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar to you after reading about cryptocurrencies, you are on the right track. The blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge, and countless others is under the hood of the NFT market as well. The difference is that in the case of NFTs, the digital ledger tracks property rights to a specific file rather than amounts of interchangeable virtual currency.</p>

<p>The first-ever NFT was &lsquo;minted&rsquo; in May 2014 on the Namecoin blockchain. Seven years later, when the technology went mainstream, ownership of the pioneering piece of art <a href="https://static.mccoyspace.com/gifs/quantum.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> &lsquo;Quantum&rsquo; was <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/quantum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> by its creator, Kevin McCoy, for $1,472,000 at Sotheby&rsquo;s. You can download a copy of the gif file by right-clicking and saving it.</p>
<h2>Most expensive and unusual NFTs</h2>
<p>The crown for most expensive NFT ever sold is held by one based on the work of the artist known as Beeple. Ownership of &lsquo;Everydays: the First 5000 Days&rsquo;, a jpg collage of images he created as part of an earlier project, <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">netted</a> $69,346,250 at Christies in March.</p>
<p>While many NFTs are for works of visual art, anything you can link to on the internet can be traded as one. Digital films and music, video game assets, and other things have been traded this way.</p>

<p>One famous example is the first tweet ever by Jack Dorsey, the outgoing CEO of Twitter. It was <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a> for $2,915,835.47 in March, with the proceeds reportedly donated to charity. The NFT includes the tweet&rsquo;s metadata, like the timestamp.</p>
<p>In November, a virtual plot of land in the online gaming world Decentraland sold for a record amount in the platform&rsquo;s own currency, equivalent to $2,428,740. The proprietor, crypto investor Tokens.com, said its new property, which measures 6,090 virtual square feet (566 square meters), will complement the real estate owned by the company in the real world.</p>
<p>In May, UC Berkeley sold an NFT called &lsquo;The Fourth Pillar&rsquo; for $54,360. It&rsquo;s a collage of 10 pages detailing cancer immunotherapy research by James Patrick Allison, for which he shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The university kept the patent that came from the work for itself.</p>

<p>In the past, people did not need an NFT ecosystem to trade purely virtual assets. Players with deep pockets have been buying well-equipped characters in online games for decades. A night elf rogue in Blizzard&rsquo;s World of Warcraft was sold for $9,500 in 2007 &ndash; with the account subsequently suspended by the game&rsquo;s developer for violating the terms of use.</p>
<p>EVE Online, a space simulation game famous for its player-driven economy, is also known for its expensive and powerful spacecraft. Last year, one rare ship was sold in the game for $33,000, and a massive war between player factions that occurred in 2014 caused an estimated $300,000 in damage to virtual spacecraft.</p>

<p>The game Entropia Universe is particularly famous (or infamous) for setting records for hosting the most expensive pieces of virtual property, thanks to its built-in support for these transactions. A location called Crystal Palace was sold for $330,000 in 2009. Three years later, Planet Calypso fetched a whopping $6 million.</p>
<h2>Does it sound like a scam?</h2>
<p>NFTs, like many things, are as valuable as people with money decide they are. If your goal is to park your wealth somewhere, buying the bragging rights to pictures of apes in hats is essentially the same as buying Jackson Pollock paintings. And you don&rsquo;t even need an environment-controlled vault to preserve your purchase.</p>
<p>On the downside, all the risks of art investment apply here. No one can guarantee that NFTs won&rsquo;t go out of fashion in a year or two &ndash; and your virtual magical carriage turns back into a pumpkin.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are drawbacks stemming from technology itself. Modern blockchains are energy-consuming and relatively slow. Your ownership rights depend on the integrity of the link to the file listed in the ledger.</p>
<p>And the &lsquo;caveat emptor&rsquo; principle is as important as ever &ndash; if you want your purchase to come from the work&rsquo;s actual author and not someone trying to defraud both you and them.</p>

    <p><strong>Russian tennis legend Maria Sharapova admitted she was "really excited" as she took a Porsche to the British Fashion Awards in a dress made of bottles – with the designer behind the outfit making it to "show off her long legs".</strong></p>
    <p>Ever-stylish Sharapova worked with top designer&nbsp;Iris Van Herpen on the striking white and blue dress, traveling to the artist's studio in&nbsp;the Netherlands to finalize the look for the British Fashion Awards at the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p>The former world number one filmed herself <em>"basically getting stitched into the dress"</em> and having<em> "last touch-ups"</em> as she turned up the glamor and showed plenty of bottle&nbsp;on her night in the spotlight.</p>
<p><em>"British Fashion Awards prep is on point,"</em> Sharapova told her millions of online fans earlier in the day, pulling out a series of drawers to reveal various fancy pastries.</p>

<p><em>"Really excited about this evening. Many Zoom calls and a trip to Amsterdam later, I'm excited to share &ndash; and to wear &ndash; what we have been up to."</em></p>
<p>Explaining that the design was crafted from 800 recycled water bottles and organic silk, she added:&nbsp;<em>"One year in the making. Yep &ndash; we are happy. But my favorite? The fries after the red carpet."</em></p>
<p>As she made her way to the event in the luxury car, Sharapova confessed: <em>"I may look cosy but I'm just hoping this seat position doesn't ruin any of the hand-stitched petals."</em></p>

<p>Van Herpen suggested that Sharapova had been the ideal model and creative partner for her sustainable dress.</p>
<p><em>"She has a fantastic body,"</em> the designer&nbsp;who has previously worked with&nbsp;the likes of pop star Bjork told <a href="https://www.numero.com/fr/mode/iris-van-herpen-evian-maria-sharapova" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Numero</a>.</p>
<p><em>"She is very tall with very nice proportions &ndash; and, of course, very athletic.&nbsp;So the dress was really designed to emphasize those proportions and show off her long legs and shoulders, which she really wanted the cut to accentuate.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Paris Saint-Germain have revealed that Lionel Messi missed training the morning after he won the Ballon d'Or – and their announcement suggests that he could be set to miss at least one game in the French giants' busy schedule.</strong></p>

<p>The Argentina captain was awarded France Football's prestigious gong for the world's best player for a record seventh time at the&nbsp;end of a star-studded ceremony at the&nbsp;Theatre du Chatelet in the French capital on Monday.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old had attended the gala with&nbsp;wife Antonella and&nbsp;their three sons and appeared all smiles before and after receiving the honor.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday morning, while seven gold goats were laid out in the front of the Eiffel Tower by sponsor Adidas,&nbsp;Messi and compatriot Leandro Paredes did not report for coach Mauricio Pochettino's session.</p>
<p>A statement from the Ligue 1&nbsp;leaders said that the&nbsp;pair had shown&nbsp;symptoms of&nbsp;gastroenteritis,&nbsp;with an update on their progress expected&nbsp;on Wednesday ahead their domestic clash with Nice in the evening.</p>

<p>PSG now face the prospect of being without Messi for at least part of a run of three games in six days.</p>
<p>Their top-of-the-table clash at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday is followed by a trip to fifth-placed Lens on Saturday and&nbsp;a visit from Club Brugge in their final Champions League group stage game next Tuesday, having already reached the knockout stage.</p>
<p>Despite his likely frustration at losing Messi to another issue after absences across the early season through knee and hamstring knocks, Pochettino was happier to publicly congratulate the striker and his family.</p>

<p><em>"Let him take advantage [of it], and I hope that this day can be the first of the construction of an eighth. Why not?"</em></p>
<p>On Twitter, a joker asked if generational rival Cristiano Ronaldo had spiked the food at the Ballon d'Or ceremony to spark Messi's illness.</p>

<p>Following a horror ankle twist at the weekend, sustained in a 3-1 win over Saint Etienne&nbsp;in which Messi provided a hat-trick of assists, the&nbsp;Brazil talisman is facing a lay-off of between six and eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSG players have been unlucky with injuries and illness in recent days, with Neymar Jr&nbsp;&ndash; who finished 16th in the Ballon d'Or rankings&nbsp;&ndash; suffering the worst.</p>
<p>There are some returns on the horizon, though.&nbsp;Following his personal life crisis and near-split from wife Wanda Nara, Mauro Icardi resumed training&nbsp;on Tuesday, as did Julian Draxler &ndash; although the German will continue his recovery at the club's Camp des Loges training center.</p>
<p>Absentees Georginio Wijnaldum and Ander Herrera should also rejoin the group before the end of the week.</p>

        <h1>Twitter announces more censorship for sake of ‘public interest’</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-11-30T17:29:57+00:00">30 Nov, 2021 17:29</time>

    <p><strong>Twitter has updated its policy on personal information to cover videos and photos of private individuals shared without their consent, unless that is done by legacy media, in “public interest,” or other context they approve of.</strong></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person&rsquo;s privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm. The misuse of private media can affect everyone, but can have a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities,&rdquo;</em> Twitter&rsquo;s Safety division <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> on Tuesday.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/541671-twitter-dorsey-agrawal-censorship/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The company has thus decided to add <em>&ldquo;media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted&rdquo;</em> to the category of <em>&ldquo;personal information&rdquo;</em> not allowed on the platform. Addresses, identity documents, phone numbers, emails, and bank information of private individuals have already been banned under Twitter&rsquo;s doxing policy.</p>
<p>This policy update <em>&ldquo;will allow us to take action on media that is shared without any explicit abusive content, provided it&rsquo;s posted without the consent of the person depicted,&rdquo;</em> Twitter said.</p>
<p>It does not apply to media featuring public figures, or when media are shared <em>&ldquo;in the public interest or add value to public discourse,&rdquo;</em> however. A specific carve-out seems to be sharing images or videos of private individuals <em>&ldquo;in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, such as in the aftermath of a violent event, or as part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value,&rdquo; </em>which<em> &ldquo;might outweigh the safety risks to a person.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Twitter <em>&ldquo;will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared,&rdquo;</em> including whether it is being <em>&ldquo;covered by mainstream/traditional media&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;adds value to the public discourse, is being shared in public interest, or is relevant to the community.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Reactions to the policy update have been mainly negative. <em>&ldquo;Twitter Implements New Rule So It Can Selectively Ban Memes, Mockery Of Democrats&rdquo;</em> is how the conservative-leaning Federalist reported the policy change.</p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">

<p>Conservative pundit Dana Loesch <a href="https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/1465716799496937473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> this will allow Twitter to <em>&ldquo;muzzle&rdquo;</em> independent journalists, let <em>&ldquo;corporate press&rdquo;</em> set narratives, and silence undercover reporting from the likes of Project Veritas. Independent journalist Tim Pool <a href="https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1465699071990005761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that <em>&ldquo;journalism is largely banned on twitter basically.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The new rule seems <em>&ldquo;poorly thought out,&rdquo;</em> tweeted digital rights advocate Evan Greer, asking <em>&ldquo;how long before cops try to abuse this to get videos of brutality taken down?&rdquo;</em></p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">

            </iframe>

<p>As written, the update is <em>&ldquo;not only vague, but literally unenforceable,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Shayan86/status/1465723873685614599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> BBC&rsquo;s &lsquo;disinformation&rsquo; reporter Shayan Sardarizadeh. <em>&ldquo;How do you define a private individual across different jurisdictions? What exactly is a public setting and what is in the public interest? What is traditional media? This is a minefield.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The policy update comes less than a day after co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as Twitter CEO, appointing Parag Agrawal as his successor. Agrawal is best known for a November 2020 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012066/emtech-stage-twitters-cto-on-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> in which he said Twitter&rsquo;s role is <em>&ldquo;not to be bound by the First Amendment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So, we focused way less on what's true and what's false. We focus way more on potential for harm as a result of certain content being amplified on the platform without appropriate context,&rdquo;</em> Agrawal also said at the time.</p>

        <h1>Nutcracker reworked to be less offensive to Asians</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-11-30T17:30:28+00:00">30 Nov, 2021 17:30</time>

    <p><strong>Ballet companies have shaken up the festive season classic ‘The Nutcracker’, in an effort to make Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s fairytale less offensive to Asians and more in tune with modern racial sensibilities.</strong></p>
    <p>The Pacific Northwest Ballet, as well as dance companies from Tulsa and Boston, are among those to have taken steps to counter racial stereotypes as Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s &lsquo;Nutcracker&rsquo; returns for the festive period, The New York Times reported on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to a wave of anti-Asian sentiment, this year, Pacific Northwest Ballet&rsquo;s Nutcracker features a Green Tea Cricket character, a superhero-like figure included to counter ethnic stereotypes, while the Tulsa Ballet has added elements of martial arts to its production, choreographed by a Chinese-born dancer.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/515410-china-lunar-blackface-africa-newyear/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Meanwhile, the Boston Ballet has gone to new lengths to ensure the production won&rsquo;t offend anyone, including by introducing a Chinese ribbon dance-inspired pas de deux number.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Everybody learned a lot this year, and I just want to make sure there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing that could ever be considered as insulting to Chinese culture,&rdquo;</em> Mikko Nissinen, artistic director of Boston Ballet, told the Times.</p>
<p>Theater bosses are also abandoning traditionally accepted elements like the bamboo hats and pointed finger movements, which are often featured in the second act&rsquo;s Tea scene.</p>
<p>However, the Berlin State Ballet has gone one step further, quietly pulling the fan favorite from the Christmas schedule and replacing it with Don Quixote &ndash; a classic, albeit less frequently associated with the holiday season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With the current discussion about which repertoire is still acceptable in post-colonial times, we have to ask ourselves whether elements from the period of origin are problematic,&rdquo;</em> acting artistic director Christiane Theobald told Germany&rsquo;s Bild.</p>
<p>Theobald stated that the theater is working with Roma representatives to ensure the ballet is not offensive, adding that a scene featuring a band of gypsies is actually a<em> &ldquo;romantic clich&eacute;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Nutcracker features a number of cliches about cultures which were perceived as exotic at the time of its original production. Another recurring complaint is that two of the child dancers dress in blackface.</p>
<p>Despite Western efforts to ensure holiday productions are not offensive to Asians, this year&rsquo;s Chinese TV Lunar New Year gala featured the usual blackface performers and a man dressed as a monkey &ndash; although the producers did appear to dispense with the oversized butt pads seen in previous years.</p>

    <p><em>&ldquo;As for Biden&rsquo;s announcement about his possible re-election, I think he was absolutely correct to do so,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. <em>&ldquo;Because if election preparations were already beginning in America, the management of the country would suffer significantly,&rdquo;</em> he continued. <em>&ldquo;The president of the US doesn&rsquo;t need my feedback, but I think he acted absolutely correctly.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Reports began circulating earlier this month that Biden was planning a bid for a second term, and the White House confirmed his intention to run in 2024 in a statement last week. He had previously indicated during a news conference in March that he expected to run again.</p>
<p>As a candidate in the&nbsp;2020 election, Biden refused to pledge to serve only one term, but he said he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily committed to another run if he was elected in 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/22/politics/joe-biden-reelection-2024/index.html"></a></p>
<p>At 79 years old, Biden is already the oldest US president in history. If elected to a second term, he would be 82 before its start. Polls have shown his approval rating dropping over the course of his first year in office, from 53% to 43%, according to a calculation by FiveThirtyEight.</p>
<p>In the same address on Tuesday, the Russian president, whose current term also finishes in 2024, said he wasn&rsquo;t yet sure whether he would run again. <em>&ldquo;According to the constitution, I have the right to run for a new term,&rdquo;</em> he commented. <em>&ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;ll do it or not &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t decided myself. But the fact that I have this right already makes the domestic situation more stable.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Putin signed into law amendments to the Russian constitution that would allow him to run for two more six-year terms, following a nationwide vote.</p>

        <h1>Competition regulator demands Facebook ditch Giphy</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-11-30T19:30:46+00:00">30 Nov, 2021 19:30</time>

    <p><strong>The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ordered Meta, the ‘company formerly known as Facebook’, to offload money-losing recent acquisition Giphy, insisting the app could harm competition.</strong></p>
    <p>Meta, which bought the GIF-making app back in May when it was still called Facebook, has been ordered to sell Giphy &ldquo;<em>in its entirety</em>,&rdquo; according to a Tuesday press release from the CMA. The regulator body reasoned that the deal could &ldquo;<em>harm social media users and UK advertisers</em>,&rdquo; by denying or limiting other platform&rsquo;s access to Giphy gifs.</p>
<p>In doing so, Meta could start directing traffic instead to its subsidiary sites &ndash; Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp &ndash; or change the terms of access to require competitors to supply more user data in order to use the animated images on Giphy, the CMA pointed out.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/519163-facebook-giphy-merger-concerns-uk/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s the first time the CMA has attempted to undo an acquisition by the tech giant, despite the social media behemoth&rsquo;s previous purchases of competitors or their apps. It pointed out that Giphy&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>advertising services</em>&rdquo; could potentially compete with Facebook&rsquo;s own, and &ldquo;<em>would have also encouraged greater innovation from others in the market</em>&rdquo; &ndash; but they were terminated due to the merger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising</em>,&rdquo; said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group.</p>
<p>Meta responded by arguing the CMA was sending a &ldquo;<em>chilling message</em>&rdquo; to start-up entrepreneurs that they should &ldquo;<em>not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order, which Meta has the right to appeal, takes care to point out how much money will be at stake, noting that the company (which is still referred to as Facebook in the order, despite having recently begun a lavish rebranding campaign) controls &ldquo;<em>nearly half of the &pound;7 billion [$9.3 billion] display advertising market in the UK</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook bought Giphy for a reported $400 million and was said to be destined for integration into Instagram before the CMA slapped it with a &pound;50.5 million ($67.12 million) fine for failing to follow its earlier orders regarding the acquisition in October.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Existing vaccines will hopefully protect against Omicron, WHO official tells RT</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-11-30T19:35:29+00:00">30 Nov, 2021 19:35</time>

    <p><strong>Already-introduced vaccines might hopefully be capable of shielding people from severe Covid-19 disease even against the new Omicron variant, World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Russia Melita Vujnovic told RT.</strong></p>
    <p>The WHO does not have any <em>&ldquo;strong indications&rdquo;</em> so far suggesting the Covid-19 strain recently discovered in southern Africa possesses a <em>&ldquo;major immune escape&rdquo;</em> mechanism, Vujnovic said on Tuesday, adding that the UN health watchdog hopes that means the existing vaccines would work against it as they do in the case of all previous Covid-19 variants, including Delta.</p>
<p>All the existing jabs mainly prevent severe disease where a vaccinated person contracts Covid-19, the WHO representative explained. They also reduce infection rate but are still unable to break the infection chain completely, she admitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>They will provide a certain level of protection, including for the most vulnerable. That is the most important.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world is yet to find out how high this level of protection would be, Vujnovic said, adding that all the vaccine producers are currently testing their products against the new strain and are to present the results of these tests shortly.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541762-omicron-netherlands-before-reported-who/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The WHO representative also said she personally supports the idea of the jabs becoming a <em>&ldquo;global good so that we can vaccinate everybody,&rdquo;</em> when asked if vaccine patents should be suspended.</p>
<p>The UN health watchdog still does not know just how dangerous the new strain is, Vujnovic admitted. Many Omicron cases recorded in South Africa so far involved fairly young people and Covid-19 generally tends to be not so severe when it comes to this demographic, she explained.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We do not have reports at this moment that it is causing a more severe disease or that it is more lethal,&rdquo;</em> she said, adding, though, that the WHO does not possess enough epidemiological data to confirm that is indeed the case.</p>
<p>No Omicron infection clusters have so far been identified in the WHO European Region, Vujnovic also said, referring to the group comprising European nations, former Soviet states, Turkey and Israel. <em>&ldquo;Delta continues to be the predominant strain&rdquo;</em> there, she said.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of Omicron cases have been reported by several European nations, including Germany, Belgium, the UK, and the Netherlands. The latest data published by the Dutch health authorities suggest, though, that the new Covid-19 variant may have arrived to the continent earlier than previously thought.</p>

    <p><strong>Top CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has been suspended “indefinitely” from the network after new details emerged about his efforts to do damage control for his brother, ex-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, during a sexual harassment scandal.</strong></p>
    <p>CNN announced the move in a statement on Tuesday, saying that newly released documents from the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office raised&nbsp;<em data-stringify-type="italic">&ldquo;serious questions&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;about Cuomo&rsquo;s conduct. The network claimed that while it was aware Cuomo had given his brother&nbsp;<em data-stringify-type="italic">&ldquo;advice&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;during the harassment controversy, it did not realize the extent of his involvement.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541686-cuomo-covered-brother-cnn-harassment/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p><em data-stringify-type="italic">&ldquo;When Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother&rsquo;s staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged that publicly. But we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;CNN said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em data-stringify-type="italic">&ldquo;However, these documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother&rsquo;s efforts than we previously knew.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong data-stringify-type="bold">As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Released on Monday by New York AG Letitia James, the trove of documents includes text messages and emails detailing Cuomo&rsquo;s efforts to protect his brother, then the governor, from public scrutiny. In one message, the governor&rsquo;s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, asked the CNN pundit to consult his&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;sources&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;about a rumor that Politico was planning on publishing a story with additional allegations, to which Cuomo replied&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;On it.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Cuomo also offered to keep tabs on pending news reports concerning harassment allegations at other outlets.&nbsp;Governor Cuomo, who resigned in August amid the scandal, was accused of sexual misconduct by at least 12 women, with a State Assembly report issued last week claiming there was&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overwhelming evidence that the former governor engaged in sexual harassment&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;while in office. Despite resigning, the ex-governor has denied the allegations, at one point claiming that&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;playful&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;behavior was&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;misinterpreted as unwanted flirtation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The allegations of sexual misconduct overshadowed another scandal over Cuomo&rsquo;s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ex-governor has been accused of covering up coronavirus deaths at nursing homes, and was blamed for indirectly causing some of them with a controversial order to release recovering Covid-19 patients into long-term care facilities early in the pandemic.</p>

        <h1>UK advises on Christmas plans with Omicron spreading</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T08:16:36+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 08:16</time>

    <p><strong>The British health secretary has warned that the Omicron strain will continue to spread, with 22 cases of the Covid variant already identified in the country. The minister says Christmas should continue as planned.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed that 22 cases of Omicron had been recorded in the UK. <em>&ldquo;At this point in time the case numbers are very low,&rdquo;</em> he stated, adding <em>&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got 22 confirmed cases at the moment and that will go up, it will certainly go up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/541783-johnson-covid-booster-army/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Javid said that while there is not much known about the Omicron variant so far, he hoped that there would be more data within two weeks. He claimed it was highly likely that vaccines will remain effective against the mutant strain.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our best form of defence still remains our vaccines,&rdquo;</em> Javid stated, adding <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible of course, it&rsquo;s possible that it might be less effective. We just don&rsquo;t know for sure yet. But it&rsquo;s also very likely that it will remain effective against serious disease.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The health secretary told the British public that there was no need to change their Christmas plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Britain, in response to the emergence of the Omicron variant, has moved to ban travel from six southern African nations and has committed to roll out more booster vaccines over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, UK PM Boris Johnson vowed to make a booster available to all adults by the end of January, after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advised opening the campaign to all adults.</p>
<p>To date, 31% of those over 12 have received a booster shot.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>Russia are one of 12 teams in the World Cup play-off draw on Friday. Here's how they could reach the finals in Qatar in 2022.</strong></p>
    <p>After missing out on automatic qualification in agonizing fashion earlier this month, Russia are two matches away from a place at the showpiece next winter via the play-offs.</p>
<p>Securing&nbsp;a place at a third successive World Cup could require an encounter with Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes or the relatively straightforward prospect of two home wins against sides ranked below Russia.</p>
<p><strong>How did Russia get here?</strong></p>
<p>You could argue that Russia were very unlucky not to have qualified outright for the 2022 World Cup, having been nine minutes of normal time away from doing so courtesy of the 0-0 draw they were on course for in Croatia in their final qualification match.</p>

<p>As it was, ill-fated veteran defender Fyodor Kudryashov, who appeared to be carrying an injury, was unable to shift his feet quickly enough to prevent himself from inadvertently diverting a desperate-looking late Croatia cross into his own net.</p>
<p>That came at the end of a gutsy performance by Russia in the backyard of the 2018 World Cup finalists on a near-waterlogged pitch, although critics would contest that Valeri Karpin&rsquo;s side deserved defeat after spending the entire game defending.</p>
<p>Karpin himself suggested that Russia showed a lack of courage and ambition to keep the ball and attack, but even that was perhaps forgivable considering how much was at stake, the quality of the opposition and the dreadful conditions.</p>
<p>In any case, a place in the play-offs was a consolatory reward for a spirited effort and a result that was tough to take.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the teams in the draw?</strong></p>
<p>There are 12 teams in the draw, made up of Russia and nine other nations who also finished as runners-up in their groups. Two more, Austria and the Czech Republic, are in because of their overall UEFA Nations League rankings for 2020/21.</p>
<p>Two huge heavyweights are involved: EURO 2020 winners Italy should have qualified comfortably but contrived to finish two points behind Switzerland via two draws with the group winners and a goalless stalemate at minnows Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The team Italy succeeded as EURO winners, Portugal, missed out in even more dramatic circumstances, suffering an unlikely defeat at home to Serbia in a winner-takes-all group-stage finale that left Cristiano Ronaldo in tears after his side spurned an early lead and lost to a 90th-minute winner in Lisbon earlier this month.</p>
<p>Scotland, Sweden, Wales, North Macedonia, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine are also in the hat.</p>
<p><strong>How does the draw work?</strong></p>
<p>There are three paths: A, B and C. Each path comprises two semi-finals that will be drawn, with the winners&nbsp;in each path playing a final against the other winning team allocated to that path.</p>
<p>All of the ties are one-legged, with the teams from Pot 1 playing at home in the semi-finals. The Pot 1 teams are Russia, Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Wales. The Pot 2 teams are Austria, Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine.</p>

<p>At the same time as the draw for the paths and semifinals is made, a draw will decide which of the semifinal tie winners will play at home in the final of their path. Certain teams cannot be drawn against each other, including Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>What are Russia&rsquo;s chances?</strong></p>
<p>Playing at home in the semfinal against a team from Pot 2 should give Russia a considerable advantage. They cannot face Italy, Portugal or the other two teams from the contenders ranked inside the top 20, Sweden and Wales, at that stage.</p>
<p>Poland are the highest-ranked team they could host, sitting seven places above Russia in 27th, but Paulo Sousa&rsquo;s side tanked at EURO 2020 and hardly dazzled in qualifying despite having Champions League-winning goal machine Robert Lewandowski within their ranks, losing their final fixture at home to Hungary as they finished six points behind winners England.</p>
<p>Russia are unbeaten in eight games as hosts and have scored nine times without reply in four home games since Karpin took over after their underwhelming EURO campaign.</p>

<p>That record is heavily embellished, though, by wins against the whipping boys of their qualifying group: 6-0 over Cyprus and 2-0 over Malta.</p>
<p>While the figures look promising, Russia could realistically be described as on-par and unproven under Karpin so far. Their real test is likely to come in a potential final.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the best-case draw for Russia?</strong></p>
<p>There can be no denying that North Macedonia are by far the weakest team on paper in the draw.</p>
<p>Their 67th-placed ranking means they are a chasmic 30 spots below next-nearest play-off hopefuls Turkey, making their win over Iceland in their final game to reach this stage all the more impressive. They have not scored a goal on the way to losing all four of their matches against Russia in their history.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540763-why-isnt-russia-better-football/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>There would probably be equal confidence on both sides were Russia to be drawn against any of their other possible opponents in Pot 2, in which case you would expect being at home to make them favorites.</p>
<p>Russia must also hope they are drawn at home for their potential final and that it is against a weaker side: either a Pot 2 contender causing an upset or Scotland from Pot 1, although a final against Sweden or Wales could also inspire belief.</p>
<p><strong>And the worst-case draw?</strong></p>
<p>Underdog motivation aside, no Russia fan will want to see Italy or Portugal on their path to the promised land.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the abundant quality within their ranks, the two giants of European football are likely to have fire in their bellies after the ignominy of missing out on automatic qualification and be intent on earning what they will see as their rightful place at the top table.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540249-croatia-russia-world-cup-result/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Russia would face a test of a far stiffer nature than they did in Croatia were they to draw either of those teams, and there would be scant cause for optimism given the thrashings they endured against comparable countries Belgium and Denmark this summer.</p>
<p>As for prospective semifinal rivals, Turkey look resurgent under new boss Stefan Kuntz, Czech Republic reached the EURO quarterfinals and Poland bolster Ballon d&rsquo;Or contender Lewandowski with a variety of players from top-flight clubs across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen if Russia reach the World Cup?</strong></p>
<p>The move to replace Stanislav Cherchesov, who led Russia to the quarterfinals of the 2018 finals, with Karpin in July will seem vindicated if Russia can come through a tough qualification challenge.</p>
<p>They might not have been expected to shine at EURO 2020, but going out with a whimper to the Danes and finishing with a goal difference of minus five suggested a side in decline, and prising Karpin away from Rostov quickly led to a purported clean sweep.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540261-serbia-portugal-world-cup-qualifying-mitrovic/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Karpin will be expected to oversee a better show than Russia put on in the summer, and will undoubtedly be buoyed by winning the play-offs and entering his first tournament as an international manager, having played at the 1994 and 2002 editions of the World Cup.</p>
<p>Russia have not reached the knockout stage of the tournament in four attempts away from home soil, stretching back to 1986 and featuring just three wins along the way..</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the situation if Russia don&rsquo;t make it?</strong></p>
<p>That would probably depend on the manner of their exit from the play-offs, as a narrow exit to the big two would probably be perceived very differently to, say, a limp defeat to a Pot 2 team.</p>
<p>Karpin&rsquo;s approach so far has been viewed as pragmatic &ndash; ousting former captain Artem Dzyuba while still turning to players widely&nbsp;thought to&nbsp;be past their best, ceding 74 percent of possession to Slovakia while winning 1-0 at home &ndash; but that could be&nbsp;regarded as conservative rigidity without results to show for it.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540645-denmark-protest-qatar-world-cup/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Karpin has a contract until the end of the World Cup campaign, which suggests he will need to guide Russia to tangible progress at the finals in order to be sure of keeping his job.</p>
<p>Beyond those immediate concerns, Russia would have something to look forward to in the form of the draw for EURO 2024 qualifying, which will take place in October 2022 to decide which countries will face each other on the road to the finals in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>When are the play-offs and when is the 2022 World Cup?</strong></p>
<p>The draw will be held at 5pm CET on Friday 26 November.</p>
<p>Russia will be at home in the semifinals on 24 March 2022. Should they win, they will be in a final five days later, on 29 March.</p>
<p>The finals in Qatar are expected to take place from 21 November until 18 December 2022, with the finals draw held the previous April.</p>

        <h1>French say ‘non merci’ to nonbinary pronouns</h1>

    <p><strong>France is choking on ‘le wokisme,’ as speakers of the New Normal’s argot struggle to convert their fellows – forcing them through linguistic hoops that are not compatible with French language or culture.</strong></p>
    <p>French First Lady Brigitte Macron has affirmed the language has &ldquo;<em>two pronouns: he and she</em>&rdquo; (<em>il</em> and <em>elle</em>, en Fran&ccedil;ais).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Our language is beautiful. And two pronouns are appropriate</em>,&rdquo; she declared succinctly earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541770-france-zemmour-macron-president/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Such seemingly-innocuous words have France&rsquo;s would-be woke activists up in arms, accusing the centrist government of &ldquo;<em>violence</em>.&rdquo; Non-binary student Lilian Delhomme told the New York Times the expression &ldquo;<em>made [them] lose hope</em>,&rdquo; suggesting the age difference between the Macrons should have changed the first lady&rsquo;s perspective on social norms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, like the distaste many native Spanish speakers feel toward &ldquo;<em>Latinx</em>&rdquo; &ndash; the genderless stand-in meant to delineate a Latino or Latina individual by woke (usually white) organizers in an effort to appear inclusive &ndash; most French-speakers find it at the very least unpleasant to attempt to communicate without gender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their language is structured based upon it. There&rsquo;s no getting around the masculine and feminine nouns that describe every object &ndash; not that the wannabe-woke among the French haven&rsquo;t tried it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A movement for so-called &ldquo;<em>inclusive writing</em>&rdquo; has butted heads with France&rsquo;s famously conservative Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise, which described any changes put forth by the would-be reformers as &ldquo;<em>harmful to the practice and intelligibility of the French language.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t stopped a small but determined contingent from attempting to adopt a genderless pronoun, importing &ldquo;<em>le wokisme</em>&rdquo; from the US with the neologism &ldquo;<em>iel&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;(a mixture between the masculine &ldquo;<em>il</em>&rdquo; and the feminine &ldquo;<em>elle</em>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going so well for iel, though. Center-right legislator Fran&ccedil;ois Jolivet has spearheaded a campaign to keep the gender-neutral pronoun out of Le Petit Robert dictionary, declaring its inclusion to be a form of &ldquo;<em>militancy</em>&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;<em>you legitimize words, you legitimize thoughts</em>,&rdquo; he said, describing himself in an interview with the French press as &ldquo;<em>a tolerant man convinced that &lsquo;iel&rsquo; was the wrong battle</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541727-france-britain-channel-crossings-row/"></a></li>

<p>Even left-wing outlet Lib&eacute;ration seems to not be entertaining the genderless American way, one headline snarkily describing &ldquo;<em>The Highway to Iel</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The linguistic conservatism of the French is protected not only by the Academie fran&ccedil;aise&rsquo;s staunch opposition to what one member recently termed &ldquo;<em>brainless Globish</em>,&rdquo; but by a hard-coded avoidance of racial politics &ndash; the country is legally prohibited from compiling racial statistics, making it nearly impossible for le wokisme to find a foothold.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;<em>iel</em>&rdquo; made it into Le Petit Robert &ndash; the online edition, at least &ndash; upsetting education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, who accused the publisher of &ldquo;<em>manipulat[ing] the French language</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Iel</em>,&rdquo; he said, was a clear expression of &ldquo;<em>wokisme</em>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a subject he is familiar with, having blamed a backlash against American wokeness for the 2016 election of US President Donald Trump. Five years later, he has the French first lady on his side.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Macrons have proved to be a surprising ally for some. The French president &ndash; hardly a staunch conservative in the eyes of his supporters &ndash; might at first appear to be an easy convert to wokisme. Yet even he has bristled amid the onslaught of &lsquo;brainless Globish,&rsquo; deeming &ldquo;<em>certain social science theories entirely imported from the United States</em>&rdquo; as a potential threat to French culture.</p>
<p>However, Robert&rsquo;s managing director, Charles Bimbenet, echoed his American counterparts in defense of whatever &ldquo;<em>wokisme</em>&rdquo; might have found its way into his dictionary, insisting the reference book&rsquo;s mission was &ldquo;<em>to observe the evolution of a French language that is in motion and diverse, and take account of that</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Americans might say &ndash; and Macron might once have echoed &ndash; &ldquo;<em>diversity is our strength.</em>&rdquo;</p>

        <h1>Michigan school shooting suspect took a gun bought on Black Friday – police</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T08:04:24+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 08:04</time>

    <p><strong>The 15-year-old suspect in the Oxford High School shooting used a handgun that his father bought four days earlier and carried as many as 45 rounds with him, the Oakland County Sheriff’s office said.</strong></p>
    <p>The weapon in question was a 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 pistol, Sheriff Mike Bouchard told the media later Tuesday during an update about the investigation into the school shooting in Michigan. It was purchased by the alleged shooter&rsquo;s father four days before the incident.</p>
<p>The suspect had two 15-round magazines for the firearm on him, including one with seven remaining rounds. The father reportedly bought three magazines, and police expect they will find the third one at the school premises. Bouchard said investigators recovered 12 shell casings at the scene. Earlier in the day Undersheriff Mike McCabe estimated that the shooter used anywhere from 15 to 20 rounds after opening fire at other students.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541799-school-shooting-oxford-michigan/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The suspect was not identified by the police because he is a juvenile. He surrendered to officers responding to the shooting, who found him exiting the school with the pistol in his hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After being taken into custody, the suspect used his right to remain silent and asked for an attorney, the sheriff said. Investigators have searched the home of the suspect&rsquo;s parents and seized his phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bouchard indicated that the father may face charges related to his ownership of the gun used in the shooting. He also said the police were not aware of any disciplinary problems or bullying regarding the teen suspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bouchard confirmed that photos of a firearm resembling the one used in the shooting were posted by somebody on social media. He said the police didn&rsquo;t consider it an indication of a credible threat since the photos were taken in the context of a practice shooting.</p>
<p>The gun <em>&ldquo;was a recent weapon purchase that he had been shooting with it. And they posted pictures of [a] target and the weapon,&rdquo;</em> Bouchard said.</p>
<p>Media reported that there had been rumblings among local parents that some act of violence could happen soon. Some students stayed home on Tuesday. McCabe said the rumors were being investigated, adding that <em>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s all kinds of stuff out on social media. Please don&rsquo;t believe everything you hear and see on social media.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The shooting has claimed the lives of three students aged 14, 16, and 17, one of whom died in a patrol car as a deputy rushed to a hospital. Seven students and a 47-year-old teacher were injured by the gunfire. Three kids reportedly remain in critical condition. The school is located in Oxford Township in Oakland County northwest of Detroit.</p>

        <h1>New Omicron variant could spell end for Covid-19 pandemic – top Russian scientist</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-11-30T11:44:06+00:00">30 Nov, 2021 11:44</time>

    <p><strong>A new mutant strain of Covid-19 that has sparked fears for vaccine resistance, caused flight cancellations, and sent the stock market plummeting could actually help bring the pandemic to an end, a Russian virologist has claimed.</strong></p>
    <p>In an interview published on Monday in Moscow tabloid KP, Anatoly Altshtein, a virologist at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which pioneered Russia&rsquo;s Sputnik V jab, said that there it is still not clear how deadly or infectious the new Omicron variant might be. According to him, even if it does spread faster than its predecessor, known as Delta, it could take months to become the predominant form of the virus.</p>
<p>Even if that happens, he said, it&rsquo;s not clear that Omicron means higher death tolls than at present.<em> &ldquo;Right now there are reasons to think that the Omicron variant could be less pathogenic,&rdquo;</em> he went on, meaning less able to cause harmful infection.</p>
<p>Explaining the science behind the hypothesis, Altshtein said that <em>&ldquo;we already see Omicron has many mutations, more than Delta. More than thirty in a single gene of its spike protein. This is too many, and it means the virus has an unstable genome. As a rule, this sort of infectious agent becomes less dangerous, because evolutionarily, an overwhelming number of mutations leads to a weakening of the virus&rsquo;s ability to cause disease.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the professor, if this rule holds true, then Omicron would be fatal in only a small fraction of cases, and would become like other common seasonal infections.</p>
<p>He stressed that we still understand little about the new variant, discovered by South African scientists last week, and that it was best to be cautious while its characteristics are researched.</p>
<p>Some nations, including Japan and Israel, have announced they are banning all foreign travelers.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid that the Omicron variant is spreading widely,&rdquo; </em>said Professor Altshtein,<em> &ldquo;but that it could turn out to be the most pathogenic variant, making infection worse.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia has registered a record number of Covid-19 deaths almost every day for several weeks, as the country grapples with a sharp rise in cases. The government has said that the rising mortality rate is due to the fact only around 40% of the population has been vaccinated, urging citizens to sign up for jabs. The country&rsquo;s parliament is now considering proposals to mandate proof of vaccination for those using public transport, eating in restaurants and cafes or attending mass events nationwide.</p>

    <p>More than half of Americans (52%) see China as the greatest threat to the country, according to a Beacon Research poll that was commissioned by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation &amp; Institute (RRPFI), a conservative think tank, and published on Wednesday. By comparison, 14% said Russia was the main threat, and 12% said the same about North Korea.</p>
<p>Only 21% listed Beijing as the chief threat to the US in 2018, when RRPFI published its first annual national defense survey.</p>
<p>Additionally, 65% respondents said they considered China an enemy, while 23% said they viewed it as an ally.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is bipartisan consensus about the threats we face. For the first time, a majority of respondents say a single nation poses the greatest threat to the United States: China,&rdquo;</em> RRPFI said in a statement.</p>

    </ul>


<p>Explaining what concerns them the most about China, those polled cited China&rsquo;s economic practices (20%), military build-up (19%), alleged human rights abuses (17%), and foreign policy (13%). Separately, 23% said they were concerned with Beijing&rsquo;s AI technology, and another 23% said they were concerned with supply chain vulnerability.</p>
<p>The number of Americans who think the US should concentrate its military forces in East Asia grew from 16% in 2019 to 37%, the survey shows. <em>&ldquo;Conversely, the percentage choosing the Middle East dropped from 37% in 2019 to 17%,&rdquo;</em> Beacon Research said.</p>
<p>US-Chinese relations deteriorated significantly in recent years after Washington launched a trade war against Beijing during the Donald Trump administration. The countries also clashed on the world stage over issues ranging from allegations of hacking and espionage, to Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as accusing each other of stoking military tensions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this year that China represents America&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>China has repeatedly said the US should abandon what it considers a Cold War mentality. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin in June urged the US not to view Beijing as <em>&ldquo;an imaginary enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

        <h1>Left-wing wife of ousted Honduran leader wins presidential election</h1>

    <p><strong>Xiomara Castro, the wife of ousted former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, was pronounced the winner of Honduras’ presidential election on Tuesday after rival Nasry Asfura conceded defeat.</strong></p>
    <p>Asfura conceded the election after 52% of the counted votes showed Castro had a clear majority of 53% over Asfura&rsquo;s 34% and he publicly <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/honduras-ruling-party-candidate-concedes-014401226.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">congratulated</a> her victory, saying, <em>&ldquo;I hope that God illuminates and guides her so that her administration does the best for the benefit of all of us Hondurans, to achieve development and the desires for democracy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also congratulated Castro for becoming Honduras&rsquo; first female president and said the US was looking forward to working with her government.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/466687-zelaya-honduras-interview-coup/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p><em>&ldquo;We congratulate Hondurans for the high voter turnout, peaceful participation, and active civil society engagement that marked this election, signaling an enduring commitment to the democratic process,&rdquo;</em> Blinken declared.</p>
<p>Castro previously served as Honduras&rsquo; first lady between 2006 and 2009, up until her husband Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a military coup. Zelaya claimed the US was behind the coup and attributed it to his signing of Hugo Chavez&rsquo;s Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The US warned me: If you sign the Bolivarian Alternative to the Americas (ALBA), you&rsquo;re going to have problems with the US. I signed it, and six months later, I had problems,&rdquo;</em> he told RT America in 2019, adding, <em>&ldquo;When you give them competition in the free market, they stop being capitalist. They become retrograde, authoritarian, and they play coups, wars, invasions.&rdquo;</em></p>
