    <p><strong>The New York Times has identified another culprit in its war on ‚Äúmisinformation,‚Äù claiming that cute animals featured in viral content help to spread right-wing propaganda and coronavirus conspiracies.</strong></p>
    <p>In the article, titled &lsquo;Those Cute Cats Online? They Help Spread Misinformation&rsquo;, New York Times technology reporter Davey Alba&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/technology/misinformation-cute-cats-online.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;videos and GIFs of cute animals &mdash; usually cats&rdquo;</em> were being used by <em>&ldquo;people and organizations peddling false information online.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Alba listed the US conservative publication Western Journal and the anti-Beijing newspaper The Epoch Times as just a few examples of outlets supposedly using animal content to redirect unsuspecting viewers towards <em>&ldquo;misinformation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the article, The Epoch Times has featured cute animals in 12,062 social media posts across 103 Facebook pages, with the posts containing links towards the newspaper&rsquo;s more political content.</p>
<p>The report received mixed reaction on social media, with critics <a href="https://twitter.com/Cowboysilhouet1/status/1466195746009628673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling</a> its claims <em>&ldquo;preposterous&rdquo;</em> and an overreaction.</p>

    <p><strong>The Premier League match between Watford and Chelsea and the meeting between Southampton and Leicester both had to be halted due to medical emergencies in the crowd on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
    <p>The game at Watford&rsquo;s Vicarage Road was suspended for more than 30 minutes after a fan suffered a cardiac arrest during the first half.</p>
<p>The players left the pitch as medical staff from both teams rushed to attend to the emergency.</p>
<p>The two sets of players refused to continue with the match until they had received positive news on the fan, who was eventually stretchered out of the stadium and taken to the nearby Watford General Hospital for further treatment.</p>

<p>The game was resumed just over half an hour later, with Chelsea going on to win 2-1 to maintain their position at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
<p>Both clubs shared messages of support for the fan who had been affected.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the second half of the match between Southampton and Leicester at St. Mary&rsquo;s was delayed by around 15 minutes after a supporter was taken ill.</p>
<p>The fan had collapsed during the interval but the issue was not said to be a cardiac arrest. The person received treatment inside the stadium before being taken to hospital.</p>

    <p><strong>NATO and Russia are facing off once again. At the center of the new cycle of mutual warnings and brinkmanship is Ukraine, which, despite being refused immediate admission to NATO, has become a major issue for Western leaders.</strong></p>
    <p>The US-led military bloc is accusing Moscow of planning a large-scale invasion and claims that such a move would have grave consequences. Russia rejects the accusation and, in turn, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/with-us-intelligence-nato-discuss-russian-intent-near-ukraine-2021-11-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> NATO that its expansion in Ukraine, whether by a formal membership or informally by other means of military cooperation and infrastructure, is a red line for Moscow.</p>
<p>There is broad consensus that this is a dangerous situation that the world could do without. Even with no one really wanting large-scale war, an escalation is, of course, possible, be it by accident or by malevolent actors. Especially in this case, given Ukraine&rsquo;s far-right forces are not really under Kiev&rsquo;s control, and are exploiting high tension for provocation. It is also clear that such a war would be catastrophic. In the <em>&ldquo;best&rdquo;</em> case, the actual fighting would remain limited to Ukraine, which would be devastated, while the political and economic consequences would be global. In the worst <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/11/24/what-war-with-russia-over-ukraine-would-really-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">case</a>, the fighting would spread beyond Ukraine and could involve the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>How did we get here? One answer is simple and misleading: just blaming Russia will not do. Because if you, unrealistically, assign all responsibility to the other side of a conflict, then you cannot even begin to think about what your own side could do better. If that&rsquo;s too abstract, think about how we got through the Cold War without blowing up the world. In essence, by three things: a mix of sheer undeserved luck, obstinacy, and compromise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can only hope about the luck. But the other two components of that proven humanity-survival recipe are up to us: While Cold War reenactors love to recall the obstinacy (or <em>&ldquo;determination&rdquo;</em>), they forget about the compromise. And yet, we are still here because compromise is how the Berlin crises and the Cuban missile standoff ended, for instance. No compromise, no world. Yes, as simple as that. Not always, but at decisive turning points.</p>
<p>But to be able to find a compromise, you have to do two difficult things: exercise empathy with your annoying opponent, and be self-critical. Put simply, accept that your potential enemy usually also has a point; and question your own assumptions, aims, and demands.</p>
<p>Is the West able to do so at this point? By far not well enough. Part of the reason is that NATO itself has become an obstacle to a genuine rethink. Not so much by its existence as by its increasingly ideologized self-understanding. Of course, an organization born in the Cold War has always been ideological. Yet during the Cold War, the base reality of the superpower standoff overshadowed the superstructure of ideology.</p>
<p>Symptomatically, however, NATO is now an organization that invests heavily and proudly in <em>&ldquo;strategic communications,&rdquo; &ldquo;outreach,&rdquo; &ldquo;branding,&rdquo;</em> and other forms of public relations. Make no mistake, these activities long predate the crisis of 2014 or any Russian efforts at <em>&ldquo;information war.&rdquo;</em> It was in 2010 that a NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy <a href="https://www.nato.int/nidc/docs/Public_Diplomacy_and_the_NATO_brand.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> &ndash; in oddly colonial terms &ndash; that her organization was engaged in a constant <em>&ldquo;battle for hearts and minds.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if we politely refrain from calling such activities propaganda, there is a hefty, usually overlooked cost to them: They may look a little comical, with, for instance, sophisticated manuals on visual branding that illustrate such things as where to put the NATO logo on an <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/129138.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">umbrella</a>. But they have a scary side: What if NATO&rsquo;s leaders believe their own branding? Because that is a perennial problem with engaging in propaganda: You can start believing your own act.&nbsp;</p>

    </ul>


<p>In NATO&rsquo;s case, this tendency is boosted by the manner in which it has prospered after the Cold War. With now 30 members (the most recent one, North Macedonia, joined in 2020), the alliance was founded in 1949, at the <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/quicktakes/why-nato-at-70-is-facing-new-doubt-and-criticism-quicktake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dawn</a> of the Cold War. That conflict ended more than thirty years ago. Unlike the Warsaw Pact, its great Cold War adversary, NATO did not abolish itself after its end: The East&rsquo;s main military alliance of the Cold War lost its purpose and disappeared. The West&rsquo;s main military alliance of the Cold War also lost its purpose but set out to do, in essence, two things: reinvent its reasons to exist and expand. Both processes have not stopped to this day.</p>
<p>In terms of purpose, NATO presents itself as not only a military, but also a political <a href="https://www.nato.int/nato-welcome/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alliance</a>, promoting &ldquo;<em>democratic values&rdquo;</em> and peace, while ready for military action if needed.</p>
<p>The geographical scope of its post-Cold War missions and activities has been wide.</p>
<p>Current locations include Kosovo, the Mediterranean, Iraq, Africa, Albania, Montenegro, Slovenia and the Benelux countries as well as the Baltic region. Already finished are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52060.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">involvements</a> in Afghanistan, the Gulf of Aden, at the Horn of Africa, Libya, Sudan, North Macedonia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina.&nbsp;Most recently, NATO has predictably <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/quicktakes/why-nato-at-70-is-facing-new-doubt-and-criticism-quicktake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obeyed</a> its American hegemon and started making noises about China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the involvement in Libya and Afghanistan have demonstrated with brutal clarity, the bloc&rsquo;s ongoing search for a purpose has led to mixed results. Some post-Cold War NATO activities have made sense, others have not, and some have contributed to abysmal fiascos. The recent turn against China is likely to be nonsensical rhetoric at best, but it has already <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nato-chief-criticism-china-showed-075016890.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFescE-qpeCUnInP1_Dy1egMQ48UJjQZ4MA7nsXZ1XZgStvin9ivdM08pSvADHFPP16pEB8ggyPvs3FN_MKEGt-zhzBRxL9wXUXdGdKW2cPITr5EaKYQWyMvXtnG9iEw1E-Z9h7YqBUafCrHDBRQLxiB94CBOsaewWYeG-V4cdzJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provoked</a> a fierce Chinese response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever its actual post-Cold War record, in terms of expansion, NATO has done very well for itself. At the end of the Cold War it had 16 members, now it has 30, and it won&rsquo;t call an end to its permanent acquisition spree.</p>
<p>Critics exist. Some attack the bloc for still being there. In their view, it has long outlived its role and should have dissolved after the end of the Cold War, perhaps to be replaced by a different organization. More down-to-earth complaints include its lack of focus and the uneven sharing of its burdens among its members.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541858-putin-demands-nato-deal/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>More specifically, NATO&rsquo;s massive and &ndash; historically &ndash; rapid eastward expansion has triggered continuing debates between those incorrectly denying that it broke assurances made to the Soviet leadership, and thus, practically Russia, and those who, plausibly and with evidence, acknowledge that fact. The bloc&rsquo;s current activities in eastern and southeastern Europe, especially in the Baltic and Black Sea areas, also receive widely differing assessments. Presented by many as nothing but a reasonable response to Russia&rsquo;s activities, especially with regard to Ukraine, to more cautious observers, they disregard legitimate Russian security interests and thus risk unnecessary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/opinion/biden-nato-summit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">escalation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brings us back to NATO&rsquo;s underlying problem. In essence, the post-Cold War alliance has been too successful at doing the wrong thing, namely being promiscuous about its purpose and developing an ideology of over-reach. NATO might be winning its <em>&ldquo;battle for hearts and minds.&rdquo;</em> Tragically, the minds it is defeating seem to be, most of all, its own. Caught in a flattering self-image as a global force of democratic redemption, the vision of its leaders is blurred. Not by the fog of war, but of self-imposed ideology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that respect, the fresh standoff over Ukraine is a call to go back to basics: NATO is good at being a defensive security alliance with clearly delimited borders. But, as a free-floating, ever expanding &ldquo;<em>democracy&rdquo;</em>-promotion machine on a global crusade, it is confused and destabilizing. Here&rsquo;s the irony &ndash; or tragedy: NATO survived the end of the Cold War, for better and for worse, by cutting itself loose from its original purpose. Now, precisely because tension with Russia is back, it is time to remember that and stop the endless search for new missions and new members.</p>

        <h1>Refugees on Belarus border can already claim asylum ‚Äì EU</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T06:43:16+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 06:43</time>

    <p><strong>Migrants living in makeshift camps on the border between Belarus and the EU are permitted to claim asylum and seek safety within countries in the region, but nowhere else, one of the bloc‚Äôs top officials has announced.</strong></p>
    <p>This would rule out Germany, the stated preferred destination of many.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, European Commissioner Margaritis Schinas explained&nbsp;that the refugees&nbsp;could apply for asylum in the EU country whose border they were on, including Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, but not in other member states.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t request asylum in one of those three countries, they can also request asylum in Belarus itself, because Belarus is part of the Geneva Convention,&rdquo;</em> he explained, pointing to the fact the Eastern European nation is a signatory to the refugees&rsquo; rights pact.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541771-belarus-invite-nuclear-weapon/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson also asserted that refugees did not have the right to choose which European country they would live in. <em>&ldquo;If you came to EU territory illegally and don&rsquo;t want to apply for asylum in your country of residence, you can be made to leave,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>
<p>There were exceptions, she noted, for migrants who would be likely to face danger in their home countries. <em>&ldquo;This applies to those who would run into problems if they returned home. For example, Belarusian oppositionists,&rdquo;</em> she clarified, implying this provision wouldn&rsquo;t apply to most of the Middle Eastern refugees fleeing war-torn nations. <em>&ldquo;For the rest, the rule is that you don&rsquo;t have the right to choose where you request asylum, if you came to the EU illegally.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a decree published Tuesday night, Poland imposed a three-month ban on anyone entering the border region without permission. The ban will cover 183 towns and villages in areas along the frontier from December until March.</p>
<p>The lower house of the Polish parliament voted down an amendment that would have allowed journalists to freely enter the restricted zones. According to the law as it was implemented, journalists will need to get permission from the Polish Border Service to enter.</p>
<p>The EU has blamed Belarus for the sharp rise in the number of people illegally trying to cross the border, saying Minsk has put on flights for desperate people from countries like Iraq and Syria, and then funneled them to the border as retaliation against sanctions.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier this month, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko admitted it was possible some of his officials had helped the would-be asylum seekers to cross over, but said it wasn&rsquo;t worth looking into. Minsk accuses the bloc of orchestrating a <em>&ldquo;hybrid war&rdquo;</em> by hosting exiled opposition figures and media outlets banned within Belarus.</p>

    <p><strong>A viral video claiming to show armed Ukrainian personnel shooting a group of migrants along the frontier with Belarus is fake, Ukraine‚Äôs Border Guard said in a statement on Wednesday, denying such an incident ever happened.</strong></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;This information is untrue,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;officials claimed, denouncing a video that recently surfaced on social media as <em>&ldquo;a fake.&rdquo;</em> No groups of illegal migrants were discovered on Ukraine&rsquo;s border with Belarus, they added, calling on Ukrainians not to disseminate <em>&ldquo;false information&rdquo;</em> and trust <em>&ldquo;only verified and official sources.&rdquo;</em></p>

    </ul>


<p>The video in question, taken on an infrared camera, was allegedly recorded on November 29. The footage shows a group of people moving in two columns in complete darkness. It is unclear through which territory they are moving but some sources then promptly claimed that it was the exclusion zone surrounding Ukraine&rsquo;s infamous Chernobyl nuclear power plant, near the northern frontier with Belarus.</p>
<p>At some point, the people are seen rushing back while some of them fall to the ground. Later, the footage&nbsp;shows another group of people closing in on those lying on the ground, with at least one of them shooting what appears to be an assault rifle.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Ukrainian side&nbsp;did not comment on the contents of the video but said that it is not the first time such <em>&ldquo;fake messages&rdquo;</em> are disseminated. Previous fake reports supposedly suggested that a group of refugees&nbsp;were detained in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Kiev refuted these allegations&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>The statement comes amid an ongoing migrant crisis on the Belarusian border with Poland that saw weeks of attempts by thousands of migrants from troubled countries like Iraq and Syria to get into the EU. Brussels blamed Belarus for putting on flights from these states as part of a <em>&ldquo;hybrid war&rdquo;</em> against the bloc &ndash; something that Minsk repeatedly denied, claiming it now simply can't afford better policing&nbsp;due to heavy sanctions imposed by the West.</p>

    <p><strong>Washington and Seoul agreed on Thursday to update their joint war plans and maintain the current number of US troops in South Korea in response to a potential North Korean threat.</strong></p>
    <p>In a press conference on Thursday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the two nations had <em>&ldquo;discussed a wide range of topics, including our unity in the face of the threat from North Korea, and our progress in our bilateral alliance, readiness and training exercises.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">

<p>Claiming the alliance contributes to stability in the region, Austin said that they had reaffirmed their <em>&ldquo;shared assessment that the DPRK is continuing to advance its missile and weapons programs, which is increasingly destabilizing for regional stability.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The United States and the ROK remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK, and we continue to call upon the DPRK to engage in dialogue. But we also discussed measures to enhance our combined deterrence posture, and to defend against the full range of threats.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US will maintain its presence of around 28,500 troops in South Korea, with the nation&rsquo;s defense minister, Suh Wook, saying the two had discussed the transfer of operational control to Korean authorities.</p>
<p>The new document for wartime operation plans, the Strategic Planning Guidance, seeks to <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20211202004200325?section=news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a> the strategy for curbing a North Korean threat after critics claimed prior plans were outdated in the wake of the country&rsquo;s expanding technology.</p>

        <h1>Why China‚Äôs Uyghurs are back in the headlines</h1>

        <address><a>Tom Fowdy</a></address>        <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T06:01:36+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 06:01</time>

    <p><strong>After months of silence, the Western media have refocused their attention on the Uyghurs of China‚Äôs Xinjiang region. The agenda is simple ‚Äì to manufacture public consent for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.</strong></p>
    <p>A couple of months ago, I wrote&nbsp;a piece for RT pointing out that for the time being, the United States appeared to have shelved the Xinjiang issue &ndash; its accusation that China was waging genocide against the Turkic minority group known as the Uyghurs in the far-western province.</p>
<p>I noted that the Biden administration seemed to be strategically limiting confrontation with China, and creating some space for engagement, which resulted in the admittedly frosty Xi-Biden virtual summit last month.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/537249-beijing-uighur-genocide-china/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Now that the summit is out of the way, and the Beijing Winter Olympics is on the horizon, it is no coincidence that, after months of silence on Xinjiang, the mainstream media in the West has started pushing new angles and so-called revelations, as well as a number of conspicuous anti-China reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past week alone, we&rsquo;ve had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59456541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempts</a> to deepen the links of Xi Jinping to the situation in Xinjiang via &lsquo;leaked documents&rsquo;, accusations that China is&nbsp;developing surveillance <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59441379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech</a>&nbsp;to target journalists, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-59486286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> about China extraditing <em>&ldquo;Taiwanese nationals&rdquo;</em> who are accused of fraud in other countries to its own territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be obvious &ndash; except for many it won&rsquo;t be &ndash; that this tidal wave of anti-China propaganda is a deliberately coordinated effort to manufacture consent for a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics and an attempt to humiliate China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous sources in the media have already&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3156592/joe-biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> that the Biden administration has already decided on a boycott, and others, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, may follow suit. This explains the onslaught of anti-China atrocity propaganda, with much more to come, including the findings of the&nbsp;<a href="https://uyghurtribunal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lsquo;Uyghur Tribunal&rsquo;</a>, which are scheduled to be published later this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is pure, unbridled manipulation and political theatre, yet ultimately Western audiences will fall for it in the belief that what they are being fed is the objective, impartial truth on matters of concern.</p>
<p>In reality, it is a form of &lsquo;manufacturing consent&rsquo; &ndash; a term most famously associated with linguist and media scholar Noam Chomsky, who penned a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12617.Manufacturing_Consent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> of the same name. His essays on the matter are of unparalleled value. He&nbsp;<a href="https://chomsky.info/consent01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a> to us that manufacturing consent is a construct whereby the US government effectively manipulates and coordinates mass media to replicate its narrative in order to buy public support for aggressive foreign policies under the guise of highlighting issues of <em>&ldquo;moral concern&rdquo;</em> &ndash; most usually claims of atrocities or other human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chomsky's work explores how an army of think tanks, so-called experts, and other mediums are weaponised to establish talking points and set a stage of debate. Such coverage is always strictly according to preference, and deliberately and hypocritically ignores similar abuses or atrocities in other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why, for example, does the media talk about China, but not Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s brutal war in Yemen? Why does it not demonize Vietnam as a similarly evil communist regime? Yet part of the process is that if the US intended to create a narrative against either country, it could.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/540414-us-china-virtual-summit-biden-xi/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>This is how it controls public consciousness; the public buy into this because they are taught to believe they are enlightened, and that their ideology represents the ultimate political and moral truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, they assume that when it comes to foreign policy, their governments do not act out of self-interest or deception, but legitimately promote the values they profess to hold against a target demonized through the constant application of atrocity propaganda. They are conditioned to think the mainstream media is independent and impartial and that propaganda is only something adversarial countries do.</p>
<p>In line with this, cherry-picked experts are given a platform to legitimate these claims &ndash; such as German anti-communist scholar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/29/leaked-papers-link-xinjiang-crackdown-with-china-leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adrian Zenz</a>, who has become the constant &lsquo;go-to man&rsquo; on Xinjiang &ndash; as well as dissidents, and a debate is generated on the grounds of &lsquo;we must do something&rsquo;, building up to the agenda the government in question wishes to push. For a historical example, see the notorious claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and so the UK and US had to go to war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Despite the level of deception involved in that effort, Western audiences don&rsquo;t appear to have learned any lessons, and &lsquo;genocide in Xinjiang&rsquo; is simply the latest claim periodically weaponised in this way to legitimate various policy goals of the US government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang and the Uyghurs have been an instrumental strategic tool used to reset US policy on China, largely throughout the Trump era &ndash; and to push allied countries to do the same. The Xinjiang claims first began appearing in 2018, when the Trump administration unleashed its trade war on Beijing and began to reorient US policy towards competition with China.</p>
<p>Their early usage involved legitimating allegations against Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and Hikvision, to justify sanctions against them. Throughout 2019, the issue was largely frozen in order to sustain trade talks between China and the US. Then in 2020, as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a01564ba-37d5-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lsquo;phase one deal&rsquo;</a> was completed and Trump sought to go all out against China in view of the election and the pandemic, the Xinjiang story was ramped up again at a greater intensity.</p>
<p>This pattern continued after Trump lost the election in a strategic bid to box Biden in on China, with the legally flawed&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/19/china-uighurs-genocide-us-pompeo-blinken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declaration</a> of &lsquo;genocide&rsquo; by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/541764-china-covid-coronavirus-omicron-beijing-olympics/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>In its early months, the Biden administration continued to weaponise Xinjiang with a view to setting the scene for its presidency, marshalling allies and undermining China&rsquo;s Comprehensive Investment Agreement with the EU, before shelving the issue for a period of time. And now it has returned, in a bid to manufacture consent for a diplomatic boycott of the Olympics, which, while largely symbolic and inconsequential, aims to deprive China of attaining any legitimacy from the event.</p>
<p>As just one example of how coordinated and deceitful the whole process is, within moments of the new Xinjiang &lsquo;leaked documents&rsquo; being published in the media, you had members of the anti-China group&nbsp;<a href="https://ipac.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPAC</a> immediately&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ipacglobal/status/1465687845591564290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanding</a> a boycott in the British Parliament.</p>
<p>Yes, there are human rights problems in the tightly controlled Xinjiang region. It is a strict area of control owing to the legacy of ethnic conflict and terrorism. Beijing has sought to assimilate the Uyghur group in order to secure stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new documents attempt to insinuate that Xi Jinping is complicit by affirming he made comments about assimilation, yet President Emmanuel Macron of France has arguably made harsher arguments for the same thing with regard to French Muslims.</p>
<p>Would the integration of French Muslims ever be characterised as &lsquo;genocide&rsquo;? The absurdity of this suggestion illustrates how the hysteria of the Xinjiang coverage deliberately omits what is a mixed picture, and ignores the prosperity and opportunity brought to Uyghurs, as well as affirmative action programs the Chinese government runs in their favour. Many Uyghurs are members and officials of the Communist Party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In which case, the all-out crusade and posturing on the issue of the Uyghurs can be seen as a deliberately deceitful and opportunist act pushed by an American government which has a long and well documented history of waging atrocity propaganda to attract support for its highly aggressive foreign policy, under the guise of self-righteousness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People should be aware of what is happening and not fall for it again.</p>

        <h1>China summons Japanese ambassador in Taiwan row</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T02:46:44+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 02:46</time>

    <p><strong>Japan‚Äôs ambassador to Beijing was summoned by China to an emergency meeting after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would not stand by if China took measures to reclaim Taiwan.</strong></p>
    <p>The ambassador was summoned by China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, and Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-summons-japan-envoy-over-former-pm-abes-taiwan-comments-2021-12-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protested</a> that Abe&rsquo;s warning had <em>&ldquo;openly challenged China's sovereignty and gave brazen support to Taiwan independence forces.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry statement said China was <em>&ldquo;resolutely opposed&rdquo;</em> to Abe&rsquo;s comments and had made <em>&ldquo;stern representations&rdquo;</em> to Japan.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541851-china-taiwan-japan-abe/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The controversy was sparked after Abe issued a warning to Chinese President Xi Jinping at a forum for the Institute for National Policy Research &ndash; a Taiwanese think tank &ndash; on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In his speech, Abe said <em>&ldquo;a Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-US alliance,&rdquo;</em> before warning that China would be committing <em>&ldquo;economic suicide&rdquo;</em> if it attempts to take military action against the island.</p>
<p>Abe served as prime minister between December 2012 and September 2020, before being succeeded by Yoshihide Suga and most recently Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>Beijing sees Taiwan as an inalienable part of its territory under its One-China policy, while the island&rsquo;s pro-independence leaders have enjoyed backing from Washington, with Taipei hosting high-profile US delegations on a regular basis. Tokyo has consistently voiced support for the status-quo in Taiwan Strait, sounding the alarm over <em>&ldquo;a sense of crisis&rdquo;</em> in the region. In its latest white paper, the Japanese Ministry of Defense called maintaining stability and security in the region one of Japan&rsquo;s top priorities.</p>
<p>Tokyo has also been embroiled in a long-running territorial dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands.</p>

        <h1>CIA hushed up own child sex crimes, newly-released documents reveal</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T05:40:23+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 05:40</time>

    <p><strong>The CIA had evidence that at least 10 of its employees were involved in child sex crimes; however, only one was ever charged with a crime while the rest were dealt with internally, according to newly released documents.</strong></p>
    <p>The bombshell revelation was reported by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/cia-employees-sex-crimes-children-secret-files-foia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed News</a>, which obtained hundreds of internal CIA reports through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits. The documents date from 2004 to 2019, and it took the outlet nearly a decade to gain access to them.</p>
<p>According to the documents, one of the 10 CIA staffers had <em>&ldquo;inappropriate sexual activity with an unidentified two-year-old girl&rdquo;</em> and admitted to having sexual contact with a six-year-old on <em>&ldquo;two separate occasions.&rdquo;</em> The employee was fired from the agency but never charged.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/472343-cia-afghan-paramilitaries-war-crimes/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>A second employee allegedly purchased sexual videos of young girls which were recorded by the victims&rsquo; mothers &ndash; an incident which led to his resignation, but not charges &ndash; while a CIA contractor was caught attempting to arrange sex with a child, who was actually an undercover FBI agent. His contact was revoked, but no charges were filed.</p>
<p>The only CIA employee who was actually charged for child sex crimes was also under investigation for mishandling classified material, according to BuzzFeed.</p>
<p>One unnamed former official told BuzzFeed that the CIA prefers to deal with incidents internally because employees who get charged with a crime <em>&ldquo;may inadvertently be forced to disclose sources and methods.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is not the first time that documents have been released showing a child sex crime problem at the CIA, and the agency&rsquo;s reluctance to deal with it externally.</p>
<p>In 2015, Vice News also <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/321765-cia-internal-probe-documents/">obtained</a> documents through FOIA requests which showed the CIA had knowledge of child abuse and child pornography crimes allegedly committed by its staff.</p>

        <h1>Former Trump ‚Äòfixer‚Äô to auction prison badge as NFT</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T00:56:00+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 00:56</time>

    <p><strong>A former lawyer for ex-President Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, has taken his first step into the fast-evolving world of ‚Äònon-fungible tokens‚Äô (NFTs), partnering with an art dealer to sell a digital version of his prison ID badge.</strong></p>
    <p>Released from custody last week after serving nearly three years over campaign finance violations and fraud charges, the disbarred attorney is already looking to parlay his sentence into profit. On Wednesday, Cohen launched an auction and <em>&ldquo;exhibition&rdquo;</em> for his <em>&ldquo;prison badge,&rdquo;</em> as well as a page from his memoir and a video clip of himself writing that page &ndash; all in the form of NFTs, an innovative way to buy and sell art and other virtual property, which amount to digital ownership documents listed on a public database, or blockchain.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Michael Cohen, Donald Trump&rsquo;s notorious &lsquo;fixer&rsquo;... will display and auction the first page of his memoir backed by a non-fungible token (NFT) containing a video of Cohen writing the page at Miami Art Week this week,&rdquo;</em> ArtGrail, an NFT-focused art dealer, announced in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/01/2344070/0/en/Michael-Cohen-Releases-NFT-backed-Handwritten-Page-from-Memoir-Federal-Prison-Badge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, adding that Cohen&rsquo;s prison ID would also be sold as an NFT souvenir later this month.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/541738-nft-virtual-property-trade/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Most existing NFTs are hosted on the same blockchain database used by Ethereum, a cryptocurrency, though other crypto platforms are also beginning to support the concept. When one buys an NFT, which can essentially represent anything digital, they are listed in the database as the virtual owner of that content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though NFTs are quickly becoming a popular way to trade artwork, the tokens have been used for a litany of purposes &ndash; some harder to grasp than others. Twitter&rsquo;s now-former CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, auctioned off his first-ever tweet as an NFT earlier this year for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than $2 million</a>, granting the buyer the odd distinction of <em>&ldquo;owning&rdquo;</em> a public, years-old Twitter post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yet clear how much Cohen and ArtGrail hope to bring in from the former lawyer&rsquo;s prison mementos, with no bids listed on the art dealer&rsquo;s site. ArtGrail has largely worked alongside artists in the past, and currently features only <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/01/2344080/0/en/Ghostface-Killah-Jason-of-Beverly-Hills-Release-NFT-backed-Gold-Coin-via-ArtGrails-com.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one other active auction</a>: An NFT representing a one-pound solid gold coin created from a bracelet previously owned by rapper Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan.</p>

        <h1>Musk takes dig at new Twitter CEO with Stalin comparison</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T00:18:26+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 00:18</time>

    <p><strong>Tesla CEO Elon Musk mocked Jack Dorsey‚Äôs replacement as Twitter CEO with a photo referencing Joseph Stalin‚Äôs purges ‚Äì comparing new CEO Parag Agrawal to the Soviet leader and Dorsey to one of his victims.</strong></p>
    <p>Dorsey announced on Monday that he would be <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541661-jack-dorsey-leaves-twitter-board/">stepping</a> down from his role as CEO of Twitter, which he had held since 2015. Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal was named as Dorsey&rsquo;s replacement and he thanked his predecessor in a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465732264151564289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> which showed the two together.</p>
<p>Though there did not appear to be any bad blood between Dorsey and Agrawal, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk trolled the two with a meme on Wednesday, which showed Agrawal&rsquo;s face pasted onto Stalin&rsquo;s body and Dorsey&rsquo;s face pasted onto Stalin&rsquo;s Interior Ministry [NKVD] chief, Nikolai Yezhov.</p>
            <figure class="op-interactive">
            <iframe>
                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/OL2hnKngTx">pic.twitter.com/OL2hnKngTx</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1466074646240014340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            </iframe>
        </figure>
    

<p>The meme appeared to reference an infamous case of censorship under Stalin, where the Soviet leader had Yezhov removed from a photo after he fell out of favor and was executed in a purge.</p>
<p>Just days into the job, Agrawal has banned sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent in what critics have blasted as&nbsp;a crackdown on independent journalism on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541788-twitter-private-media-ban/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Agrawal has also taken heat for old Twitter posts about religion and race.</p>
<p>Whether Musk was suggesting that Dorsey was forcefully pushed out of his role by Agrawal remains unclear. In a tweet earlier this week, Musk seemed to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465386361012297731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">praise</a> Agrawal&rsquo;s promotion, saying <em>&ldquo;USA benefits greatly from Indian talent!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Though Dorsey claimed in his resignation announcement that the decision was his own and that Agrawal had been his personal choice for replacement, others have suggested that Dorsey was ousted &ndash; pointing to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/elliot-managements-paul-singer-seeks-to-replace-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-source-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> from 2020 which claimed billionaire and Twitter board member Paul Singer was trying to get rid of him.</p>

    <p><strong>Most Americans of all political persuasions distrust large pharmaceutical companies, think their priority is profit and not helping people, and believe they have too much influence on the government, according to a new poll.</strong></p>
    <p>Only 6% of American voters trust big pharmaceutical companies <em>&ldquo;a lot,&rdquo;</em> while 19% don&rsquo;t trust them at all, and 53% distrust them to some degree,&nbsp;according to a Rasmussen Reports poll published on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Three out of four respondents think Big Pharma is motivated by profit. There was remarkably little divergence on this issue along party lines, with 78% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats and 75% of unaffiliated voters in agreement. Only 14% think the drug companies are concerned with making their customers&rsquo; lives better.&nbsp;</p>

    </ul>


<p>Meanwhile, 70% of voters say the drug-makers have too much influence on government and public policy.</p>
<p>The national online and phone survey was conducted by Rasmussen earlier this week, on a sample of 1,000 likely voters with a 95% level of confidence and a three-percentage-point margin of sampling error.</p>
<p>The poll results come after the Biden administration <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541690-omicron-cdc-booster-expansion/">updated recommendations</a> for Covid-19 booster jabs and expanded vaccination, citing the new Omicron strain of the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either when they are six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or two months after their initial J&amp;J vaccine,&rdquo;</em> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Monday.</p>

    <p>The military announced the upcoming deployment in a <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/2855047/virginia-guard-task-force-begins-federal-active-duty-for-africa-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> earlier this week, saying that more than 1,000 soldiers from the Kentucky and Virginia National Guards are being prepped for a mission in Africa, the largest <em>&ldquo;single-unit mobilization&rdquo;</em> for the VNG since World War 2.</p>
<p>Dubbed &lsquo;Task Force Red Dragon,&rsquo; the troops will take part in the Pentagon&rsquo;s multi-national counter-terrorism operation in the Horn of Africa, and are <em>&ldquo;trained and equipped to accomplish a wide range of missions throughout the US Africa Command area of responsibility,&rdquo;</em> the Guard said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[Their] primary objective is to provide security for the forward operating bases maintained by the Department of Defense to build partnerships with host nations and improve safety and stability in the region.</strong></em></p>

<p>The soldiers are expected to be sent to the continent sometime in early 2022, according to a Guard source <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/11/29/1000-national-guard-soldiers-deploy-africa-mid-east-wars-wind-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a> by Military.com. While the spokesperson did not specify their destination, the US joint counter-terrorism mission in Eastern Africa is based out of Djibouti&rsquo;s Camp Lemonnier, where some 3,400 American personnel are currently stationed. It is unclear if the Guard soldiers will mark an increase in the overall troop level, or replace others already deployed.</p>
<p>The creation of the new task force comes despite vows from the Joe Biden administration to wind down the sprawling War on Terror launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which has seen US military operations in more than a dozen countries. Though Biden made good on his predecessor&rsquo;s plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan earlier this year, extensive anti-terror operations have continued across the Middle East and Africa. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-regarding-the-war-powers-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> sent to Congress over the summer, the administration outlined its global military footprint, acknowledging ongoing airstrikes on various militant groups in East Africa and train-and-advise missions with local security forces elsewhere on the continent.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>The suspect behind last month‚Äôs Waukesha Christmas parade massacre, which killed six people and injured 62 more, has claimed he feels ‚Äúdehumanized‚Äù and ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù in the aftermath of the attack.</strong></p>
    <p>39-year-old Darrell Brooks Jr. &ndash; a registered sex offender with a lengthy history of arrests &ndash; has been in jail for ten days as the chief suspect behind the deadly November attack. Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, he said he feels <em>&ldquo;dehumanized&rdquo;</em> by the coverage of the case.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I just feel like I'm being monster &ndash; demonized,&rdquo;</em> Brooks told two Fox News reporters, who were reportedly the first visitors he had received in jail since his arrest.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541581-cnn-car-waukesha-christmas-parade/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>He also told the news network that even his mother had not visited since he allegedly drove his car into a crowd of Christmas parade attendees in Waukesha, Wisconsin on November 21.</p>
<p>Brooks&rsquo; mother, Dawn Woods, blamed a lack of mental health resources for the attack in a letter on Wednesday, claiming her son <em>&ldquo;was not given the help and resources he needed.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Brooks has an extensive criminal record and had been arrested less than a month before the attack for punching and running over a woman with the same car that was used to hit the parade attendees. He was released on a $1,000 bond not long before the parade attack.</p>
<p>Brooks has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder and is being held on a $5 million bail.</p>

        <h1>South Africa criticizes ‚Äòunscientific‚Äô restrictions over Omicron</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-02T01:18:04+00:00">2 Dec, 2021 01:18</time>

    <p><strong>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his country is being penalized for detecting the latest Covid-19 ‚Äúvariant of concern,‚Äù dubbed Omicron, urging other nations to lift travel bans imposed amid alarm over the new strain.</strong></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,&rdquo;</em> the president said during a state visit to Nigeria on Wednesday, noting that a growing number of countries had instituted travel bans on South Africa <em>&ldquo;as a result of the discovery by our scientists of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>It is our hope that the countries that have imposed these bans urgently reconsider their decisions.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541685-south-africa-doctors-omicron-symptoms/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Though Ramaphosa said he recognized nations have the right to <em>&ldquo;take the necessary precautionary measures to protect their citizens,&rdquo;</em> he stressed that <em>&ldquo;this pandemic requires collaboration and sharing of expertise,&rdquo;</em> calling on other states in the region to unite against <em>&ldquo;arbitrary,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;unscientific&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo;</em> restrictions.</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s comments echoed a statement issued by the South African Foreign Ministry over the weekend, which also declared that the country was being <em>&ldquo;punished&rdquo;</em> for its <em>&ldquo;excellent science,&rdquo;</em> saying the travel bans were <em>&ldquo;akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, while the new variant triggered near-immediate panic across Asia, Europe and beyond after it was first detected, local health officials have called for a more cautious approach. The chair of the South African Medical Association, Dr. Angelique Coetzee &ndash; who personally announced the discovery of the first Omicron patient &ndash; has argued that the <em>&ldquo;heavy travel restrictions&rdquo;</em> brought in the UK and elsewhere were hasty and unjustified.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The simple truth is: we don&rsquo;t know yet anywhere near enough about Omicron to make such judgments or to impose such policies,&rdquo;</em> Coetzee wrote in an <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10256373/Dr-ANGELIQUE-COETZEE-discovered-Omicron-says-reacting-threat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">op-ed</a> earlier this week, adding that <em>&ldquo;In South Africa, we&rsquo;ve retained a sense of perspective. We&rsquo;ve had no new regulations or talk of lockdowns because we&rsquo;re waiting to see what the variant actually means.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The United States has also imposed new travel bans on eight African nations, including South Africa, due to concerns over Omicron, with the first infection spotted in the country on Wednesday in California. Top White House Covid-19 adviser Anthony Fauci defended the policy the same day, arguing that the restrictions were needed to <em>&ldquo;buy time temporarily,&rdquo;</em> even while acknowledging some of the affected countries have not seen a single case of the new variant.</p>

    <p><strong>An internal FBI report reveals how WhatsApp and iMessage happily hand over users' data to the Feds, sometimes providing the source and destination of messages every 15 minutes.</strong></p>
    <p>The sensitive <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/document-detail/?doc-id=21114562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Bureau of Investigation </a>paper, unearthed by the transparency group Property of the People, spells out in concise yet shocking detail the Bureau&rsquo;s ability to secure messaging app content and associated metadata via warrants and subpoenas &ndash; and shows that WhatsApp and Apple&rsquo;s iMessage turn over the most information to authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dated January 7, 2021, and prepared by the FBI&rsquo;s Science and Technology Branch and Operational Technology Division, it lists a number of popular messaging apps, the methods by which information can be extracted from them, and what data can be secured by investigators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file notes that a subpoena submitted to WhatsApp owner Meta delivers <em>&ldquo;basic&rdquo;</em> user records, a court order gives<em> &ldquo;information like blocked users,&rdquo; </em>and a search warrant provides <em>&ldquo;address book contacts and WhatsApp users&rdquo; </em>who<em> </em>have the <em>&ldquo;target&rdquo; </em>saved as a contact. A surveillance request known as a <em>&ldquo;pen register&rdquo;</em> will result in WhatsApp providing the FBI with the source and destination of a user&rsquo;s messages every 15 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/541856-ai-turns-humans-waste-product/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The actual content apparently won&rsquo;t be disclosed &ndash; although even without access to messages themselves, knowing who has been texting who, and when, is still highly revealing, and could be crucial in identifying the source of leaked information within an organization, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, WhatsApp messages <em>can </em>be accessed by the Bureau if that user is using an iPhone and has enabled iCloud backups. This is facilitated by Apple maintaining a policy of turning over iCloud encryption keys in response to FBI warrants, which also grant the agency access to iMessages. Data requests filed under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 US Code &sect; 2703</a> turn up <em>&ldquo;25 days of iMessage lookups to and from a target number.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Nonetheless, WhatsApp is the only messaging platform listed that offers close-to real-time disclosure of data &ndash; the guide, presumably with some chagrin, records how the slow pace with which other apps provide information <em>&ldquo;may impact investigations due to delivery delays.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Comparatively, the amount of data that can be accessed from other messaging apps is trifling. For instance, investigators can access certain information on users of Signal &ndash; much-vaunted by privacy advocates despite <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/513732-signal-messenger-us-national-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being developed</a> with US government funding &ndash; including the date and time a user registered, and the last time they were active on the app. Telegram&rsquo;s strict policy of not cooperating with court orders, apart from <em>&ldquo;confirmed terrorist investigations,&rdquo;</em> in which the app <em>may</em> disclose IP addresses and phone numbers to relevant authorities, is also noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a rare insight into the systematic manner in which US authorities can access private information, and can only cast significant doubt on the publicly avowed positions of Apple and Facebook/Meta in respect of user privacy. It was only in September that the former&rsquo;s CEO <a href="https://time.com/6099169/tim-cook-apple-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boldly declared</a> that his company <em>&ldquo;[believes] privacy is a basic human right&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;one of the most consequential issues of our time,&rdquo; </em>boasting of how its app store had recently implemented a privacy <em>&ldquo;nutrition label&rdquo; </em>system, outlining to users what information apps collect on them and why.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all about giving the user transparency and control&hellip; It sounds simple, but it&rsquo;s a profound change. We&rsquo;re working for the user. It&rsquo;s not about a marketing slogan or a way to sell things. It&rsquo;s a core value of ours,&rdquo; </em>he claimed.</p>
<p>That such noises were absolutely just a <em>&ldquo;marketing slogan&rdquo;</em> was heavily implied in January 2020, when it was reported Apple had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jettisoned plans</a> to allow iPhone users to fully encrypt backups of their devices on iCloud two years prior, due to direct FBI pressure. Similarly, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s lengthy March 2019 op-ed for the New York Times outlining his <em>&ldquo;privacy-focused vision for social networking&rdquo; </em>was somewhat hard to swallow given that nine years earlier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he&rsquo;d proclaimed</a> privacy was no longer a <em>&ldquo;social norm&rdquo;</em>.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541651-twitter-jack-dorsey-step-down/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Still, the Facebook founder spoke with apparent passion and approval of <em>&ldquo;the future of communication&hellip; increasingly </em>[shifting] <em>to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won&rsquo;t stick around forever,&rdquo; </em>a future <em>&ldquo;I hope we will help bring about.&rdquo; </em>He specifically cited <em>&ldquo;the way we&rsquo;ve developed WhatsApp&rdquo; </em>&ndash; which he acquired in 2014, and is now the world&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular</a> messaging platform &ndash; as instructive for how all the company&rsquo;s social media assets would be made <em>&ldquo;as secure as possible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Even if that stated vision was at all sincere at the time, in the wake of <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/536872-background-facebook-whistleblower-haugen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dubious &lsquo;whistleblower&rsquo;</a> Frances Haugen going public about her <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/538116-pierre-omidyar-haugen-facebook-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged concerns</a> over the threat posed to US national security by Meta in its present form, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-calls-for-urgent-external-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely repeated</a> demands that Western governments be granted greater powers of surveillance, censorship, and control of social media and the internet more widely, it may simply no longer be feasible.</p>
<p>Facebook arguably already acts as an effective arm of US state power, or is at least subordinate to it &ndash; <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/government-data-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2020</a>, it complied with 89% of Washington&rsquo;s requests for user data. Its Threat Intelligence division, from which Haugen hails, is a <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/536872-background-facebook-whistleblower-haugen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veritable den of spies</a>, counting numerous former CIA and NSA operatives among its staff. Coincidentally, several of these individuals have contributed to the ongoing <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/522851-biden-riot-us-encrypted-spying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall of negativity</a> surrounding end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly released FBI file raises all manner of questions about the true rationale behind this long-running anti-encryption push. After all, with such an array of sensitive information so easily discoverable via standard legal procedures, why would greater access be required?</p>

    <p><strong>An outspoken NBA star has changed his last name to 'Freedom' after claiming US citizenship and told Americans that they should "stop criticizing" their country, winning praise from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</strong></p>
    <p>Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter has been at the center of a series of controversies recently, including earning his team censorship in China for his views, which featured digs at NBA great LeBron James over&nbsp;what his rival perceives as silence on alleged human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Now the Swiss-born, Turkey-raised center has changed his name to&nbsp;Enes Kanter Freedom, proudly proclaiming his novel citizenship while gushing praise for the US.</p>

<p><em>"Here there is freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of the press,"&nbsp;</em>the 29-year-old told CNN via <a href="https://people.com/sports/nba-player-enes-kanter-becomes-u-s-citizen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">People</a>, explaining his decision to alter&nbsp;his name and become an American.</p>

<p><em>"I didn't have any of those with Turkey. Freedom is the greatest thing a human being can have. That's why I wanted to make that word a part of me and carry it wherever I go."</em></p>
<p>Kanter is also said to have told Fox News&nbsp;that Americans&nbsp;should avoid&nbsp;questioning their country.</p>
<p>"People should feel really blessed and lucky to be in America because they love <em>to criticize it, but when you live in a country like Turkey or, you know, China or somewhere else, you appreciate the freedoms you have here,"</em> he said.</p>

    <p><strong>Ex-Man United and Russia footballer Andrei Kanchelskis is seeking criminal action over threats that reportedly involved breaking his legs because of a pay-off, admitting feeling "fear" but insisting he will not be intimidated.</strong></p>
    <p>The alleged incident&nbsp;reportedly related&nbsp;to Kanchelskis' work at Uzbekistan Super League&nbsp;side Navbahor Namangan.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the two-time Premier League winner left&nbsp;the club over&nbsp;claims of unpaid wages and, in August this year, FIFA obliged his former employers to make a pay-out of around $1.8 million with interest.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;episode has now taken a sinister twist, with three unknown men in face masks allegedly approaching Kanchelskis in a Moscow cafe.</p>

<p>When the former Rangers winger refused, they told him that they would break his legs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to Sport24.ru, Kanchelskis has confirmed he did received the threats and filed a police report over them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"All threats will be forwarded to FIFA and UEFA,"</em>&nbsp;he added. "This<em> matter must now be taken seriously.</em></p>
<p><em>"I think there will be more information soon. I want these people to be found and acted against them in accordance with the law.</em></p>

<p><em>"We did everything legally. It seems that we live in a civilized world, where things are not resolved like that.</em></p>

<p><em>"But what, should we now flee our home? We live and work normally, all according to plan. There will be more precedents &ndash; we will turn to law enforcement agencies again."</em></p>
<p>Kanchelskis joined Navbahor Namangan, who finished sixth in the last edition of the Uzbek top flight, in October 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After steering them to third, he resigned&nbsp;the following June before being reappointed in August 2019 on a three-year deal.</p>
<p>Kanchelskis stepped down for a second time after not being paid for four months, but world football governing body FIFA ruled in his favor and ordered&nbsp;Navbahor to pay up in 30 days&nbsp;plus&nbsp;interest and without the right to appeal.</p>
<p>Now 52, he won the Premier League twice during his time&nbsp;with United between 1991 and 1995 as part of a 20-year career that included spells in Ukraine, Scotland, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p>
<p>The winger made more than 50 appearances for the Soviet, CIS and Russia international teams.</p>

    <p><strong>NHL star Artemi Panarin has claimed he "lost his mind" because of Russia-based insults including an alleged remark about Vladimir Putin ‚Äì and the Canadian rival accused of making them has confirmed they were about his homeland.</strong></p>
    <p>The New York Rangers asked the league to investigate comments made by Brad Marchand, of the Boston Bruins, which led to the Russian star throwing a glove at his opponent.</p>
<p>Marchand has been accused of making a dig involving president Putin and has admitted that his jibes did relate to Russia.</p>
<p><em>"I said that no one in Russia likes him,"</em> said Marchand, responding to continuing attention on the row during a game on Friday.</p>

        <h1>Argentine ex-president charged in spying case</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T22:17:04+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 22:17</time>

    <p><strong>Former Argentine president Mauricio Macri has been charged with illegal spying in a case related to his government‚Äôs surveillance of grief-stricken families of a missing submarine‚Äôs crew.</strong></p>
    <p>Federal Judge Mart&iacute;ni Bava supported the indictment on Wednesday, saying that Macri was responsible for an online surveillance campaign on the relatives of the San Juan submarine sailors, who asked the government to continue searching for the submarine that went missing in November 2017.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/444234-san-juan-submarine-found/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The judge sequestered 100 million pesos (around $1 million) from Macri and banned him from leaving Argentina, local media reported, citing judicial sources. The defendant <em>&ldquo;led an unlawful spying&rdquo;</em> campaign targeting people affected by <em>&ldquo;one of the greatest tragedies&rdquo;</em> that occurred during his time in office, seeking to be in the loop of<em> &ldquo;movements&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;claims&rdquo;</em> they made, a 171-page court ruling seen by Infobae said.</p>
<p>Surveillance was allegedly conducted between December 2017 and the end of 2018. The former president supposedly initiated it because he was concerned about how the whole San Juan case could<em> &ldquo;affect the image of government.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Macri&rsquo;s lawyers said they would appeal this decision. The former president has repeatedly called the process political and said that his prosecution was linked to the legislative elections that were held in mid-November.</p>
<p>Earlier, an Argentinian court also charged two former top officials of Argentina&rsquo;s Federal Intelligence Agency, arguing that they could not have been unaware of the spying campaign and most likely had a hand in it.</p>
<p>The ARA San Juan (S-42) vanished in November 2017. The search for the diesel-electric submarine started immediately, involving ships and aircraft manned by personnel from 13 countries. After 15 days of the operation, the navy decided to end it. In late 2018, it was discovered <em>&ldquo;imploded&rdquo;</em> and lying at the bottom of the sea at a depth of 800 meters. The tragedy took the lives of all 44 sailors on board.</p>
<p>Macri could face a potential prison sentence of up to ten years if found guilty.</p>

        <h1>Key Democrat exits Congress</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T22:17:27+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 22:17</time>

    <p><strong>House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) will not seek re-election in 2022. The founder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus is the 19th House Democrat to bow out before the midterms.</strong></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to pass the baton to the next generation so I can focus on my health and well-being,&rdquo;</em> DeFazio, 74, said in a <a href="https://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-peter-defazio-announces-he-will-not-seek-re-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was a tough decision at a challenging time for our republic with the very pillars of our democracy under threat, but I am bolstered by the passion and principles of my colleagues in Congress and the ingenuity and determination of young Americans who are civically engaged and working for change,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/541897-michelle-obama-democrats-victory-2024/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The longest-serving member from Oregon, DeFazio has been in the House of Representatives for 36 years. He was among the original founders of the Progressive Caucus, now considered a major influence in internal Democrat politics.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;His legislative successes &ndash; including, most recently, helping pass the historic, once-in-a-century Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Build Back Better Act &ndash; leave an outstanding legacy of progress for America's children and future,&rdquo;</em> Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) said in response to DeFazio&rsquo;s retirement.</p>
<p>DeFazio helped pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/539517-infrastructure-bill-passed-biden/">last month</a>. Though six members of the Progressive Caucus voted against its passage, leaving the Democrats short of a majority, 13 Republicans that crossed the aisle made up for it.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, a total of 19 House Democrats have announced their retirement or a run for another office ahead of the 2022 midterms, which polls currently suggest may result in a Republican sweep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DeFazio&rsquo;s seat in Oregon&rsquo;s 4th congressional district may not be up for grabs, however, as the state legislature redrew electoral maps in September to make it more heavily Democratic. The veteran lawmaker had easily won every re-election since 1988, with the closest call being a six-point win over Republican Alex Skarlatos in 2020.</p>

        <h1>Officer fired after shooting wheelchair-bound man nine times (VIDEO)</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T21:08:13+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 21:08</time>

    <p><strong>The Tucson Police Department announced it has fired an officer who shot a 61-year-old man in a wheelchair nine times for allegedly shoplifting a toolbox from Walmart. The officer was working off-duty as a security guard.</strong></p>
    <p>A store employee claimed the wheelchair-bound man, Richard Lee Richards, refused to show a receipt for the toolbox when he was apprehended in the parking lot of the Tucson Walmart, instead brandishing a knife while saying, &ldquo;<em>Here&rsquo;s your receipt.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officer Ryan Remington then apparently followed Richards through the parking lot, &ldquo;<em>attempting to gain his cooperation</em>&rdquo; and to convince him to put down the knife.&nbsp;</p>

                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGEüö®<br><br>Officer Ryan Remington fired nine shots and killed Richard Lee Richards, 61, as he rolled his motorized wheelchair toward the entrance of a Lowe‚Äôs in Tucson. He then tried to handcuff him as he lay dead on the ground. <a href="https://t.co/wu5a43F5fT">pic.twitter.com/wu5a43F5fT</a></p>&mdash; Natasha ‚öØÕõ (@ndelriego) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndelriego/status/1466044458420551685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to a statement from Police Chief Chris Magnus, Richards &ldquo;<em>refused to comply</em>,&rdquo; leading Remington to chase Richards through the lot, at which point he reportedly shouted, &ldquo;<em>If you want me to put down the knife, you&rsquo;re going to have to shoot me</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second officer, Stephanie Taylor, joined Remington and warned him against entering a Lowe&rsquo;s that shared the Walmart parking lot. Security and bodycam footage then show Remington opening fire on Richards, who falls out of his chair after being hit nine times. Remington subsequently handcuffs Richards as he lies face down on the ground. He was declared dead shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Chief Magnus claimed he was &ldquo;<em>deeply disturbed by Officer Remington&rsquo;s actions</em>&rdquo; during a press conference on Tuesday, calling the use of &ldquo;<em>deadly force</em>&rdquo; a &ldquo;<em>clear violation of department policy.</em>&rdquo; He also said the police department &ldquo;<em>moved earlier today to terminate</em>&rdquo; Remington. The shooting will be reviewed by the Pima County Attorney&rsquo;s Office, where Remington will have the option to challenge his dismissal in civil court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tucson Mayor Regina Romero denounced the shooting as &ldquo;<em>unconscionable and indefensible</em>.&rdquo; Remington&rsquo;s lawyer, however, insisted the armed officer, who was carrying a taser in addition to his gun, &ldquo;<em>had no non-lethal options</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>In his mind, he couldn&rsquo;t use [the taser] because he didn&rsquo;t feel he had the proper spread to deploy it, with the wheelchair between him and Richards</em>,&rdquo; his attorney, Mike Storie, argued. Richards himself had served time in prison for first-degree attempted murder and illegally transporting immigrants for profit, according to local NBC affiliate station KVOA.</p>

        <h1>Kyle Rittenhouse ban lifted</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T21:02:09+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 21:02</time>

    <p><strong>Meta has removed teen Kyle Rittenhouse from the blacklist of ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù individuals and organizations. This means he could get his Facebook and Instagram accounts back, and people will be allowed to mention his name.</strong></p>
    <p>Rittenhouse was 17 when he was blacklisted by Facebook in August 2020, just days after fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during a night of rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was charged with murder but acquitted on all counts on November 19, as the jury decided he acted in legitimate self-defense.</p>

    </ul>


<p><em>&ldquo;After the verdict in Kenosha we rolled back the restrictions we had in place that limited search results from returning content related to key terms including Kyle Rittenhouse,&rdquo;</em> Meta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement on Wednesday. <em>&ldquo;While we will still remove content that celebrates the death of the individuals killed in Kenosha, we will no longer remove content containing praise or support of Rittenhouse.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Under the policy that designated the August 25, 2020 incident as <em>&ldquo;mass murder,&rdquo;</em> any posts expressing <em>&ldquo;praise and support&rdquo;</em> for Rittenhouse were considered subject to removal, while searches for his name were disabled on Facebook and Instagram &ndash; both owned by the company that recently rebranded itself as Meta.</p>
<p>The policy meant that Rittenhouse was <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/537299-facebook-hate-terrorism-blacklist/">blacklisted</a> as a <em>&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>or &ldquo;hateful&rdquo;</em> individual or group, alongside Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and his fascist Italian ally Benito Mussolini, Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Brian Fishman, the Facebook executive who announced the blacklisting of Rittenhouse, left the company on the day of the Kenosha verdict. He has <a href="https://twitter.com/brianfishman/status/1466099852366942209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insisted</a> that the timing was <em>&ldquo;entirely coincidental&rdquo;</em> and that he announced his departure at the end of October.</p>

        <h1>15-year-old school shooting suspect charged with terrorism</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T20:10:49+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 20:10</time>

    <p><strong>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has announced charges against the 15-year-old suspect in a Michigan high school shooting this week, including one count of terrorism. Four students were killed in Tuesday's attack.</strong></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Today's the start of the legal process. When we begin to gather and review all of the facts, we get to put together a full timeline of events,&rdquo;</em> McDonald, a former family court judge, said on Wednesday while revealing the charges. <em>&ldquo;It will take time, but the victims and their families and the entire community need and deserve those answers.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541824-michigan-shooting-details-update/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The shooting occurred at Oxford High School in Michigan&rsquo;s Oakland County. The 15-year-old suspect, who will be tried as an adult, will be charged with one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first degree homicide, seven counts of assault with the intent to kill, and 12 counts of possession of a firearm while committing a felony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard earlier released the identities of the victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17. The fourth victim&rsquo;s death was announced only hours before the charges were revealed on Wednesday. Six others were injured in the shooting, which was committed with a semi-automatic handgun purchased only last week by the suspect&rsquo;s father, according to authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motive for the shooting is not known, and Bouchard said on Tuesday the suspect, identified as sophomore Ethan Crumbley, has retained a lawyer and is not cooperating with investigators.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The person that&rsquo;s got the most insight and the motive is not talking,&rdquo;</em> Bouchard told reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, McDonald said on Wednesday there is enough digital evidence to prove the shooting was premeditated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is a mountain of digital evidence. Videotape, social media, all digital evidence possible,&rdquo;</em> she said. The prosecutor also said charges are being considered against the parents of the suspect, despite him being tried as an adult.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>WTA suspends tournaments in China over Peng Shuai</h1>

    <p><strong>The Women‚Äôs Tennis Association (WTA) is suspending all events in China after accusing the country of failing to investigate claims of sexual assault made by doubles star Peng Shuai against a former top government official.</strong></p>
    <p>WTA chairman and CEO Steve Simon announced the step in a statement, saying he could not ask players to compete in China <em>&ldquo;in good conscience.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am announcing the immediate suspension of all WTA tournaments in China, including Hong Kong,&rdquo;</em> read a message from Simon on t<a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/2384758/steve-simon-announces-wta-s-decision-to-suspend-tournaments-in-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he WTA website</a>.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In good conscience, I don&rsquo;t see how I can ask our athletes to compete there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely and has seemingly been pressured to contradict her allegation of sexual assault.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Given the current state of affairs, I am also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.&rdquo;</em></p>

    </ul>


<p>Peng, 35, appeared to make the accusations against former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli on the Chinese social media site Weibo at the start of November.</p>
<p>The former world doubles number one claimed she had been coerced into having sex with Zhang around three years ago, but also admitted that the pair had had an on-off consensual relationship.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;social media post&nbsp;promptly disappeared and Peng was not seen or heard from, prompting concerns for her well-being.</p>
<p>Chinese state media then released a series of images and video clips of Peng appearing in public, as well as <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540567-peng-shuai-email-breaks-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an email she had purportedly sent to the WTA</a> in which she claimed the sexual assault allegations were untrue and denied that she had gone missing.</p>
<p>Peng&nbsp;later <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540906-peng-shuai-ioc-video-bach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">held a video call</a> with International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach in which she said she was <em>"safe and well"</em>.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/541392-dick-pound-peng-shuai-video/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>However, WTA bosses continued to harbor concerns over Peng&rsquo;s accusations of sexual abuse. The organization <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540708-wta-china-threat-peng-shuai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had already threatened to pull out of China</a> before announcing the suspension of events there on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When on November 2 Peng Shuai posted an allegation of sexual assault against a top Chinese government official, the Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association recognized that Peng Shuai&rsquo;s message had to be listened to and taken seriously. The players of the WTA, not to mention women around the world, deserve nothing less,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;read the WTA statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;From that moment forward, Peng Shuai demonstrated the importance of speaking out, particularly when it comes to sexual assault, and especially when powerful people are involved. </em></p>
<p><em>"As Peng said in her post, &lsquo;Even if it is like an egg hitting a rock, or if I am like a moth drawn to the flame, inviting self-destruction, I will tell the truth about you.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;She knew the dangers she would face, yet she went public anyway. I admire her strength and courage.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>WTA boss Simon further accused the Chinese leadership of <em>&ldquo;not [addressing] this very serious issue in any credible way.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe and not subject to censorship, coercion and intimidation,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;added the tennis boss. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation &ndash; without censorship &ndash; into Peng Shuai&rsquo;s sexual assault accusation.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;None of this is acceptable nor can it become acceptable. If powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded &ndash; equality for women &ndash; would suffer an immense setback. I will not and cannot let that happen to the WTA and its players.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540501-osaka-peng-shuai-shock/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Peng&rsquo;s case has earned widespread support from across tennis, including prominent women&rsquo;s stars such as Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as well as men&rsquo;s world number one Novak Djokovic.</p>
<p>In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized what it calls the <em>&ldquo;malicious hyping&rdquo;</em> of the narrative surrounding the star.</p>
<p>Peng is a two-time doubles Grand Slam champion who became the first Chinese player &ndash; male or female &ndash; to reach the rank of world number one.</p>
<p>She has a career-high singles ranking of world number 14, and reached the semi-finals of the women&rsquo;s singles at the US Open in 2014.</p>
<p>The former official at the center of the accusations, Zhang, is now 75 and retired.</p>
<p>He was a powerful figure in the Communist Party and served as vice-premier between 2013 and 2018. He was also on the influential Politburo Standing Committee between 2012 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang has not spoken publicly about the claims against him.</p>

    <p><strong>China is facing pressure to provide assurances on the safety of women‚Äôs tennis star Peng Shuai, who is said to have disappeared after accusing a former government official of sexual assault. Here‚Äôs what we know.</strong></p>
    <h2>WHO IS PENG SHUAI?</h2>
<p>Peng Shuai is one of China&rsquo;s most recognizable sports stars. She became the first Chinese player ever to achieve a world number one ranking when she rose to the summit of the doubles ratings in 2014.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old has two Grand Slam women&rsquo;s doubles titles to her name &ndash; at Wimbledon in 2013 and at the French Open in 2014.</p>

<p>In the singles, Peng reached a career-high ranking of world number 14 back in 2011. Her best singles performance at a Grand Slam was her run to the semi-finals of the US Open in 2014.</p>
<p>Peng has 25 WTA titles to her name &ndash; 23 of which came in doubles events &ndash; and has racked up prize money of almost $10 million. She is also a three-time Olympian.</p>
<p>Peng&rsquo;s current singles ranking is world number 306, and she last appeared on the WTA tour at the Qatar Open back in February of 2020. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHAT ARE THE ACCUSATIONS?</h2>
<p>In a lengthy post on Peng&rsquo;s account on Chinese social media platform Weibo, she appeared to accuse former high-ranking Communist official Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault.</p>
<p>The message was posted on November 2 but was reportedly taken down less than half an hour later. Peng&rsquo;s name is subsequently said to have been heavily censored on the Chinese web.</p>

<p>Translated versions of the post <a href="https://twitter.com/marcos_z/status/1461089815911354376?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remain on social media</a> outside of China. In the message, Peng accuses the married Zhang of forcing her into sex after he invited her to his house around three years ago. His wife was said to be at home at the time.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That afternoon I didn't give my consent and couldn&rsquo;t stop crying,&rdquo;</em> Peng wrote. <em>&ldquo;You brought me to your house and forced me and you to have relations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The message says that the pair also had an on-off consensual relationship which had begun years previously, but that Zhang had then gone silent&nbsp;before initiating contact again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Peng admitted that she did not have evidence to back up the claims.</p>
<p>Zhang, who is now 75 and retired, was a powerful figure in the Communist Party. He served as vice-premier between 2013 and 2018, and was also on the influential Politburo Standing Committee between 2012 and 2017.</p>
<h2>WHY IS THE WTA CONCERNED?</h2>
<p>Peng&rsquo;s silence since the accusations surfaced has raised concern from the Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association (WTA).</p>
<p>In an initial statement, the WTA said the accusations by Peng <em>&ldquo;must be treated with the utmost seriousness.&rdquo;</em></p>
    
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdni.rt.com/files/2021.11/original/61979d0885f5402b71746a35.JPG">

<p>WTA chairman and chief executive Steve Simon later claimed the organization had been told by the Chinese Tennis Association that Peng <em>&ldquo;is safe and not under any physical threat.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My understanding is that she is in Beijing, but I can&rsquo;t confirm that because I haven&rsquo;t spoken directly with her,&rdquo;</em> Simon added.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540610-wta-responds-peng-shuai-email/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>However, the situation took a turn when Chinese media shared a purported email from Peng to the WTA, in which it was claimed she was not missing and that the allegations against Zhang were untrue.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been resting at home and everything is fine. Thank you again for caring about me,&rdquo; read the message.</em></p>
<p>WTA boss Simon said he had<em> &ldquo;a hard time believing&rdquo;</em> the email had actually been written by Peng. It also appeared to be a screenshot with a cursor still visible.</p>
<h2>HOW FAR IS THE WTA PREPARED TO GO?</h2>
<p>The WTA has since stepped up its calls for guarantees that Peng is safe and well.</p>
<p>Simon told media outlets on Thursday that the organization was willing to pull out of business agreements with China, potentially at risk of losing millions of dollars.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,&rdquo;</em><em>&nbsp;</em>said the WTA chief.<em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Because this is certainly bigger than the business. Women need to be respected and not censored.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Simon added:<em> &ldquo;At this point I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any validity in [the email] and we won&rsquo;t be comfortable until we have a chance to speak with her.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540708-wta-china-threat-peng-shuai/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>That stance comes in stark contrast to the likes of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has thus fan declined to comment &ndash; perhaps mindful that China is preparing to host the Winter Games in Beijing in February.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Experience shows that quiet diplomacy offers the best opportunity to find a solution for questions of such nature,&rdquo;</em> and IOC spokesperson said.</p>
<p>In the past, other sporting organizations such as the NBA <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/491519-hong-kong-leader-lebron-james/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have tended to tread carefully</a> where political and social issues involving China are concerned. That likely stems from a fear of potentially being forced out of a lucrative mass market.</p>
<p>The WTA, however, this time looks to be pushing much further &ndash; albeit in a case involving a specific individual, rather than state policy.</p>
<h2>WHAT HAS THE CHINESE RESPONSE BEEN?</h2>
<p>Peng&rsquo;s presence on the internet has reportedly been heavily censored in light of the allegations, with search terms of her name blocked.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there has been no public response from Zhang about the accusations against him.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-china-media-social-media-beijing-3c2a5e60f1412760e59594bd138ecdc8?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> that the matter was<em> &ldquo;not a diplomatic question and I&rsquo;m not aware of this situation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere, the editor-in-chief at China&rsquo;s Global Times &ndash; a state-backed outlet &ndash; suggested that the situation was being exaggerated by the foreign media.</p>

<p>Peng is far from the first high-profile figure to apparently go missing in China &ndash; even billionaire Alibaba businessman Jack Ma did so for several months before resurfacing earlier this year.</p>
<p>It has been suggested by some Chinese policy experts that Peng will also return to public view in time.</p>
<h2>HOW HAVE TENNIS STARS REACTED? &nbsp;</h2>
<p>In the meantime, prominent tennis figures continue to add their weight to calls for China to prove Peng&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>American great Serena Williams issued a social media message in which she aired her concerns, following the likes of four-time Grand Slam champion <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540501-osaka-peng-shuai-shock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Osaka</a>.</p>

<p>The hashtag &lsquo;Where Is Peng Shuai&rsquo; has been widely used. In the men&rsquo;s game, 20-time Grand Slam winner <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/540342-chinese-tennis-player-missing-peng-shuai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novak Djokovic </a>called the situation <em>&ldquo;shocking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>However, some have thus far avoided weighing in, including British US Open champion Emma Raducanu.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old has a Chinese mother and has previously <a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/534719-emma-raducanu-speaks-mandarin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued messages of thanks to her supporters in Mandarin</a>.</p>
<p>However, Raducanu&rsquo;s social media accounts had not made reference to Peng&rsquo;s case as of Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Men&rsquo;s greats Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have also not yet commented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>WATCH Police footage of MSNBC producer following Rittenhouse jury</h1>

    <p><strong>Police camera footage of an MSNBC producer seemingly admitting to following a bus of jurors in the Kyle Rittenhouse murder trial has been released, showing the journalists struggling to explain their actions.</strong></p>
    <p>The footage, taken on November 17 and released by the Law &amp; Crime Network, shows MSNBC producer James Morrison speaking with officers from his car, explaining he was told by a New York producer with his network that <em>&ldquo;these might be the people you need to follow.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Officer Jerel Jones-Denson asks to speak with the producer, Irene Byon, who struggles to explain why they were following jurors if not to publicly identify them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We were just trying to, respectfully, just trying to see if it's possible to find any leads about the case,&rdquo;</em> Byon says, stumbling through her sentences multiple times. <em>&ldquo;And so we were just keeping our distance, just to see, like, where people involved in the trial are positioned.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <figure class="op-interactive">
        
                    <div class="media__youtube">        <iframe class="media__youtube-frame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVd3p9wJJVo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>            </figure>


<p>The producer goes on to claim they were not trying to interfere with the jurors or interact with them, but the officer tells the producers to cease their course of action anyway, saying, <em>&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t afford anything crazy happening.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Byon ends by saying the producers are <em>&ldquo;very sorry&rdquo;</em> for the intrusion.</p>
<p>Judge Bruce Schroeder booted MSNBC from the Rittenhouse trial after he found out about producers following jurors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rittenhouse was found not guilty on all charges against him, including murder charges for shooting and killing two men in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August 2020 during a protest that turned violent. Rittenhouse maintained throughout the trial that he had acted in self-defense.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Threat to Russian figure skating prodigies as Norway makes push for new limit again</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T19:08:39+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 19:08</time>

    <p><strong>Days after a 15-year-old Russian sensation and Winter Olympics favorite set a new world record, Norway has resubmitted a proposal for the age limit for adult skaters in the discipline to be raised by two years.</strong></p>
    
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/541528-kamila-valieva-world-records-sochi/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Russia has a long legacy of producing figure skaters who can compete on the world stage&nbsp;from a precociously young age, the&nbsp;latest of whom is Kamila Valieva.</p>
<p>At 15, Valieva set a record-breaking short program on Friday at the Russian Grand Prix, eclipsing the previous best by almost two points.</p>
<p>Valieva is one of the strongest competitors set to take part in the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.</p>
<p>Under proposals that have been resubmitted by Norway, though, figure skaters of her age may not be allowed to compete at the Olympics and other senior showpieces in years to come.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Skating Association (NSA) is bidding to raise the age limit for figure skating with plans that will be considered at the congress of the International Skating Union (ISU) in 2022.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/541470-kamila-valieva-world-record/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Norway's previous attempt to lift the age limit, which made the congress but was postponed because of the pandemic, will not be revisited because the congress will only debate proposals put forward after December 1 2021.</p>
<p>The leadership of the NSA confirmed to Match TV that it wants to raise the limit to 17 for women and men in all ISU disciplines including figure skating and 16 for dance duets and sports couples.</p>
<p>The changes would be introduced from the 2023/2024 season and would not immediately affect any skater who has already participated&nbsp;at the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships or the World Championships.</p>
<p>The minimum current age is 15. This year's congress will take place in Phuket, Thailand.</p>

    </ul>


<p>Russian former Olympic champion&nbsp;Alexei Yagudin mocked the proposals as <em>"very funny."</em></p>
<p><em>"Norway, do you even have skaters?"</em> the four-time world champion asked, via translation. <em>"Maybe we'd better ban asthmatics in biathlon and skiing?"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Two-time Olympic champion and coaching great Evgeni Plushenko is more receptive to the debate and is principally keen for athletes to have longevity over immediacy.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Let it be discussed,"</em> he told <a href="https://russian.rt.com/sport/article/934026-cenz-figuristy-reakciya" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Russian RT</a>. <em>"We have a guide for that. I don't want to get involved in this story.</em></p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/sport/539370-elizaveta-tuktamysheva-canadian-grand-prix-zhulin/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p><em>"Will this affect many of my students? This means that they will continue to train and perform further in juniors.</em></p>
<p><em>"Sports life does not end there. You have to&nbsp;[compete]&nbsp;for a long time. I am for longevity in sports... we have a leadership, let him make a decision &ndash; this is my position."</em></p>
<p>Legendary coach&nbsp;Tatiana Tarasova&nbsp;is more bullish.<em> &ldquo;Nothing can stop our girls from winning and skating just as amazingly,"</em> she promised <a href="https://www.championat.com/figureskating/news-4530283-luchshe-by-kogo-to-vospitali-tatyana-tarasova-ob-idee-norvegii-podnyat-vozrastnoj-cenz.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Championat</a>.</p>
<p><em>"It would be better if the Norwegians tried to educate someone than to put forward any proposals.</em></p>
<p><em>"In Norway, there are no skaters at all, not a single person &ndash; what proposals can we talk about? Our girls win and will win at any age because they are the best."</em></p>

        <h1>Doctor who oversaw Epstein autopsy quits</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T18:52:28+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 18:52</time>

    <p><strong>New York City‚Äôs chief medical examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson, who oversaw the autopsy of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after his reported suicide, has resigned for a job in the private sector after nine years in office.</strong></p>
    <p>Sampson announced her impending resignation in an interview with ABC News on Monday, as opening arguments began in the trial of Epstein&rsquo;s associate Ghislaine Maxwell. After 23 years with the city&rsquo;s medical examiner office, she is taking a job with the Mount Sinai Health System.</p>

    </ul>


<p><em>&ldquo;I was clearly a role model for so many women who are interested in careers in medicine, in science, and in government. I found that now looking back extremely rewarding,&rdquo;</em> she told the outlet.</p>
<p>The first woman to serve as New York City&rsquo;s ME, Sampson oversaw multiple high-profile autopsies. In August 2014, her office ruled that Eric Garner &ndash; a black man who died during an attempted arrest in Staten Island &ndash; died of homicide caused by <em>&ldquo;compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest, and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When the police union pointed out that the hyoid bone in Garner&rsquo;s throat hadn&rsquo;t been fractured, Sampson responded it was <em>&ldquo;false&rdquo;</em> that this would have necessarily happened due to a chokehold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The officer involved was eventually fired, but was not criminally charged. Garner&rsquo;s family received a $5.9 million settlement from the city.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 2019, Sampson would rule Epstein&rsquo;s death in the Manhattan jail to be suicide. The disgraced financier had been awaiting trial on more sex trafficking charges. He allegedly used a sheet in his cell to hang himself. A Justice Department investigation found that the guards did not do any of their rounds that night, while video cameras at the facility malfunctioned.</p>
<p>The autopsy revealed Epstein&rsquo;s hyoid bone had been broken, which is possible in cases of suicide by hanging, but also happens in cases of strangulation.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Putin calls on NATO to do a deal</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T12:14:08+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 12:14</time>

    <p><strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will request talks with NATO to ensure that the US-led military bloc does not creep closer to his country's borders, as Kiev moves to allow Western troops into Ukraine.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking to a group of newly-arrived ambassadors in the Kremlin on Wednesday, Putin said that his country will <em>&ldquo;insist on guarantees being set out to exclude the possibility of NATO moving any further to the east, and deploying threatening weapons close to Russian territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I would like to emphasize that we need these to be legal guarantees,&rdquo;</em> the Russian president said, <em>&ldquo;given that our Western colleagues have not fulfilled their respective oral obligations.&nbsp;Everyone knows they made promises they wouldn't expand eastwards, but then they did the opposite. Legitimate Russian security concerns have been ignored and continue to be ignored.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541789-putin-biden-president-bid-2024/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Putin insisted that <em>&ldquo;the threat at our Western borders is really growing, and we have repeatedly talked about it. It is enough to see how close NATO&rsquo;s military infrastructure has advanced to the Russian borders. It's more than serious for us.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to him, the Kremlin is taking steps to secure the country&rsquo;s frontiers, but the president insisted that Russia poses no threat to the West. <em>&ldquo;To shift the blame, as we say, from those who are sick in the head onto those of us who are healthy is irresponsible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s remarks come amid heightened tensions between the US-led military bloc and Russia over its increased presence in Eastern Europe. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov revealed that <em>&ldquo;significant units and armaments from NATO countries, including American and British, are being moved closer to our borders.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He also blasted what he described as the West&rsquo;s long-term goal of pushing anti-Russian ventures onto other states, noting that the incorporation of former Soviet republics into the bloc is<em> &ldquo;the brightest example of this.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a recent interview with CNN, NATO&rsquo;s chief Jens Stoltenberg said that the bloc had beefed up the size of its forces threefold and upped its presence in both the Black Sea and Baltic Sea to counter Russia&rsquo;s presence. A US Navy-guided missile destroyer the &lsquo;Arleigh Burke&rsquo; was deployed to the Black Sea last week not long after two other American warships sailed through the same waters.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned that Stoltenberg&rsquo;s plans to shuttle American nuclear warheads around Eastern European nations due to supposed threats posed by Moscow&rsquo;s alleged<em> &ldquo;aggressive actions&rdquo;</em> endangered existing peace accords between the two parties.</p>
<p>Putin has previously insisted that his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, was given assurances by Western leaders that NATO would not expand into the space left after the fall of the USSR. Then, in 2017, a tranche of documents was declassified, and widely interpreted as showing that American, British, and German officials gave assurances to the Kremlin in the 1990s that NATO would not push into Eastern European nations, before then admitting countries like Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</p>
<p>The purported dishonesty was cited by Putin as a strategic threat in 2014, when announcing that the country would reabsorb the Crimean Peninsula. <em>&ldquo;When the infrastructure of a military bloc is moving toward our borders, it causes us some concerns and questions. We need to take some steps in response,&rdquo;</em> he said at the time.</p>

    <p><strong>NATO member states are prepared to take action against Russia should it show aggression against neighboring Ukraine, the White House‚Äôs top diplomat has announced as tensions between Moscow and the US-led military bloc run high.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking at a conference in Latvia on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the organisation is <em>"ready to take serious measures, and NATO is ready to strengthen its eastern flank."</em></p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s envoy, however, insisted the military bloc does not harbor any ill intent against Moscow. <em>&ldquo;NATO is a defensive alliance,"</em> he said. <em>"We are not a threat to Russia... Every step we take is aimed at maintaining active protective measures of our alliance members, as well as helping our partners."</em></p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541858-putin-demands-nato-deal/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Also on Wednesday, the bloc&rsquo;s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, vowed that <em>&ldquo;NATO will actively contribute to building the military capabilities of Ukraine and Georgia so that they can defend themselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are conducting exercises, sharing information, providing equipment, and supporting the reform process,"</em> he said, adding that its support for the two partner states&rsquo; <em>&ldquo;sovereignty and territorial integrity remains unwavering.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The broadside from Blinken and Stoltenberg comes amid a standoff between the military bloc and Russia over its increased presence in Eastern Europe. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow will <em>&ldquo;insist on guarantees being set out to exclude the possibility of NATO moving any further to the east, and deploying threatening weapons close to Russian territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Putin also stressed that <em>&ldquo;the threat at our Western borders is really growing,&rdquo;</em> remarking that the Kremlin has incessantly voiced its concerns about this.</p>
<p>In mid-November, Stoltenberg said NATO had registered <em>&ldquo;an unusual concentration of troops&rdquo;</em> at the Russian-Ukrainian demarcation line. According to him, Moscow <em>&ldquo;has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against&rdquo;</em> Kiev.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov slammed the accusations, saying, <em>&ldquo;the movement of our armed forces on our own territory should be of no concern to anyone.&rdquo;</em> He previously dismissed purported photographic evidence of a troop buildup because it depicted units stationed hundreds of kilometers away from the shared border, closer to Belarus.</p>

    <p><strong>At a time when people are asking how long Joe Biden can survive as president, who‚Äôs best qualified to take on the Republicans in 2024? With VP Kamala Harris‚Äô poll numbers in the basement, Michelle Obama could be one to watch.</strong></p>
    <p>Earlier this week, Business Insider<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-2022-midterms-republican-agenda-investigation-oversight-impeachment-2021-11?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> proclaimed</a>, with all the liberal indignation it could muster, that <em>&ldquo;Republicans can&rsquo;t wait to make Joe Biden's life miserable&rdquo;</em> in the event the GOP dominates in next year&rsquo;s midterms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the article glaringly failed to understand, however, is that Joe Biden needs no help making his life miserable. From failing to protect the southern border amid a pandemic, to severely<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57422456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> curtailing</a> America&rsquo;s energy independence, to leaving behind hundreds of US civilians in Afghanistan amid the worst-conceived military withdrawal in recent memory, Joe Biden is Joe Biden&rsquo;s worst enemy.</p>
<p>Never before has an American president witnessed such a dramatic turn of political fortune. Elected into office at the ripe old age of 78, with the highest number of votes in a presidential election, political pundits are already debating whether the 46th POTUS is coming or going.</p>
<p>Last week, the White House<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/582717-biden-intends-to-run-for-re-election-in-2024-psaki-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> signaled</a> that wobbly Biden would seek reelection in 2024 despite some understandable &ldquo;Democratic fears.&rdquo; This week, the political winds have already started to shift, with analysts<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1528862/Biden-2024-Democratic-Party-popularity-drop-Kamala-Harris-US-latest-VN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> saying</a> Democrats have &ldquo;given up&rdquo; on the possibility of Biden crawling back from extremely<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/18/politics/biden-approval-rating-low/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> low poll numbers</a>.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/540125-democrats-kamala-harris-biden/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>At this point in the game, the non-delusional Democrats in the party (albeit a minority) have long come around to the realization that neither Biden nor his vice president, Kamala Harris, have the slightest chance of successfully representing the Democratic ticket in 2024. Any speculation to the contrary is merely covering fire.</p>
<p>Biden will be 82 years old in 2024, and his handlers already keep him on a tight leash, ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice to call a lid on press conferences before old silver tongue has a chance to utter some impropriety.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris, who last month<a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/07/biden-approval-falls-38-midterms-loom-usa-today-suffolk-poll/6320098001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> received</a> a 28% approval rating, is about as far from presidential material as Pluto is from the Sun. Her speeches, which drone exquisitely into ethereal<a href="https://twitter.com/ShuForCongress/status/1465177955894767627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> nothingness</a>, reveal not only a conspicuous lack of charm and personality, but the depth of her intelligence, which would struggle to free itself from the shallow end of the kiddie pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Democrats will not support this woman&rsquo;s presidential bid, exactly as they<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> did not</a> in 2019, and the only reason she is now being considered as a possible candidate in 2024 is to save face; not her face, mind you, but that of the party for being so utterly shortsighted to pair her with Biden in the first place.</p>
<p>This trail of tears brings us to Michelle Obama, who has been touted as one of the last hopes to save the Democratic Party from its own excesses. At first glance, the mere thought of the former First Lady going head to head against the likes of Donald Trump, or any other Republican candidate, sounds like sheer madness. Moreover, it shows how shallow the Democratic bench is as far as raw political talent is concerned. Yet opting for Michelle Obama as the Democratic presidential contender in 2024 is not as half-baked an idea as that of Kamala Harris making a run.</p>
<p>Much like Trump, Michelle Obama has charisma and charm &ndash; boatloads more than Harris &ndash; and is hugely popular among Democratic voters (despite the fact that a recent public opinion poll somehow actually put Harris<a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/583018-poll-harris-michelle-obama-lead-for-2024-if-biden-doesnt-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> ahead</a> of Obama by three percentage points, 13% to 10%, respectively). It&rsquo;s important to remember, after all, that US elections are not determined by intelligence, but by personality and charisma &ndash; the raw essence of any baby kissing, hand-shaking politician.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/539707-texas-secession-ted-cruz/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Although Obama has little direct experience in the US political jungle, she&rsquo;s been close enough to the beast as a former First Lady to understand how it all comes together. She continues to deny that she has any political ambitions, but in the event she&rsquo;s been secretly honing her debating skills and the art of the savage retort, it is not inconceivable that she could fare very well in any future debates, even against the fearsome Orange Man.</p>
<p>With that said, I believe the Democratic Party is wasting the political talents of one of its most respected members,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4fjA0K2EeE&amp;t=226s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Tulsi Gabbard</a>, the former House representative from Hawaii and soldier who served in the Iraq war in a field medical unit.</p>
<p>Here is an incredibly articulate woman, with the most diverse resume, who has witnessed the horrors of US foreign policy first-hand. Unfortunately, it is exactly Gabbard&rsquo;s professed commitment to rid the US political system of its warmongering ways &ndash; she once<a href="https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1185289626409406464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> called</a> Hillary Clinton <em>&ldquo;the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party</em>&rdquo; &ndash; that prevents this woman from getting the attention she deserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabbard &ndash; who ran for president before suspending her election campaign &ndash; was one of seven contenders who earned delegates during the 2019 primary. Yet she was the only one not<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-only-non-white-dem-candidate-primary-delegates-confirms-she-was-not-invited-dnc-1526776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> offered</a> a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention, thereby proving once again the folly of US politics, where the American people have the freedom to vote every four years, but only for the pre-selected field of candidates chosen for them.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to wrap this up with remarks from one of the most experienced politicians in the world today, Russian President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the possibility of Joe Biden running again in 2024, Putin<a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541789-putin-biden-president-bid-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> said</a>, <em>&ldquo;As for Biden&rsquo;s announcement about his possible re-election, I think he was absolutely correct to do so. Because if election preparations were already beginning in America, the management of the country would suffer significantly.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Spoken like a true statesman.</p>

        <h1>Google violated ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be evil‚Äô motto, ex-employees say</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T17:28:05+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 17:28</time>

    <p><strong>Three former Google employees have sued the tech giant for failing to abide by its well-known ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be evil‚Äô conduct policy. They allege that the company fired them for raising concerns about its dealings with US border agencies.</strong></p>
    <p>In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21119310-google_complaint_filed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> filed on Monday in a California court, the group accuses Google of participating in <em>&ldquo;evil,&rdquo;</em> and then <em>&ldquo;terminating [their] employment...for adhering to the directive.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The three ex-workers were software engineers who claim the company wrongly fired them in 2019 over an unrelated data leak after they sent around an internal petition calling out its controversial cloud computing contract with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency.</p>
<p>The former employees, Rebecca Rivers, Sophie Waldman, and Paul Duke, are seeking unspecified financial damages on five counts, including <em>&ldquo;breach of contract&rdquo;</em> and slander &ndash; with Rivers alleging that the company&rsquo;s statements had <em>&ldquo;caused significant damage to [her] reputation and ability to become gainfully reemployed.&rdquo;</em> Google has yet to comment on the matter.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/508529-google-spied-employees-nlrb-complaint/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>According to an NPR report, Google fired the trio, and a fourth employee, in November 2019 for <em>&ldquo;clear and repeated violations&rdquo;</em> of its data security policies. But the former staffers have denied either accessing or leaking any confidential documents during their campaign. As well, they said that Google should be held accountable for not living up to its own motto.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Google realized that &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rsquo; was both costing it money and driving workers to organize,&rdquo;</em> they said in a statement on Monday. <em>&ldquo;Rather than admit that their stance had changed and lose the accompanying benefits to the company image, Google fired employees who were living the motto.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The ex-employees claim they were trying to uphold the policy, which was apparently part of their contract when they were hired. In the lawsuit, they state that they had <em>&ldquo;protested Google&rsquo;s engagement in supporting CBP policies that resulted in separation of families and &lsquo;caging&rsquo; of immigrants who were seeking asylum in the United States.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) stated that Google <em>&ldquo;arguably violated&rdquo;</em> US labor laws by <em>&ldquo;unlawfully discharging&rdquo;</em> the three employees and alleged that they had been punished in retaliation for their activism. The NLRB previously filed a separate complaint against the company.</p>

    <p><strong>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) has accused Republicans of having a ‚ÄúKu Klux Klan caucus‚Äù that is targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) and others with racist attacks.</strong></p>
    <p>The spat between Omar and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado) intensified this week as the former held a press conference and played an audio recording of a graphic phone call threatening violence against her. Omar used the call to urge action against Boebert for recent comments, including referring to her as a member of the <em>&ldquo;Jihad Squad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On the voice message, a man calls Omar multiple slurs, appears to threaten her life, and accuses her of being a terrorist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen to the phone call below (warning: graphic language):</p>

<p>Ocasio-Cortez came to the defense of her fellow &lsquo;Squad&rsquo; member on Wednesday, with a tweet accusing Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-California) of leading a &ldquo;Ku Klux Klan caucus&rdquo; in an effort to take back control of the House from Democrats.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Kevin McCarthy is so desperate to be speaker that he is working with his Ku Klux Klan caucus to look aside and allow violent targeting of woc [women of color] members of Congress,&rdquo;</em> she tweeted, adding that these threats should not be ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feud between Boebert and Omar began after a clip of Boebert went viral in which she mocked Omar as a potential terrorist. A later phone call between the two ended with Omar hanging up on Boebert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, Boebert issued an apology to anyone in the <em>&ldquo;Muslim community&rdquo;</em> that she offended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Omar has not directly responded to Boebert&rsquo;s tweet, but has called on Republican leadership to take action against the <em>&ldquo;hateful rhetoric&rdquo;</em> from the Colorado congresswoman.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This kind of hateful rhetoric and actions cannot go without punishment. There has to be accountability,&rdquo;</em> Omar said on Tuesday, adding that <em>&ldquo;if and when&rdquo;</em> Republicans fail to take action, <em>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to be our job to do that.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p><strong>The American strategy of applying sanctions to try pressure Russia highlights the fragility of Washington's position in today's world and its inability to tolerate healthy competition, Moscow has claimed.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking on the Soloviev Live YouTube channel on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented on statements from the White House that it is ready to hit Moscow with a new round of sanctions should the country escalate tensions with Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are ready for this. We are well aware of what underlies this approach &ndash; their inability to maintain competitiveness, if they [so] perceive a struggle, we see healthy competition by legal means,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541765-kuleba-kremlin-invasion-plan/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The diplomat accused the US of laying on embargoes as one of its foreign policy tools and blasted it as Washington&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; heel. <em>&ldquo;We are well aware that this is a demonstration of their own weakness and they need to clearly understand it,&rdquo;</em> she pointed out.</p>
<p>Zakharova&rsquo;s remarks came shortly after White House press secretary Jen Psaki expressed Washington&rsquo;s preparedness to slap Moscow with embargoes if necessary amid Western-led media reports that Russia is planning to strike neighboring Ukraine in the near future.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier on Tuesday at a NATO meeting in Latvia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that any aggression from Moscow toward Kiev could result in <em>&ldquo;serious consequences,&rdquo;</em> and accused Russia&rsquo;s military of conducting <em>&ldquo;unusual troop movements&rdquo;</em> along the shared demarcation line.</p>
<p>Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has previously denounced claims in Western publications that Russia is planning to invade its neighbor as mere <em>&ldquo;hysteria&rdquo;</em> being whipped up in both the Anglo-Saxon and Ukrainian media. Previously, he said that<em> &ldquo;the movement of some of our military equipment or army units across the territory of the Russian Federation is exclusively our business&rdquo;</em> and poses no threat to its neighbors.</p>

        <h1>Europe‚Äôs imminent winter energy crisis could have serious political consequences</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T15:42:55+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 15:42</time>

    <p><strong>With temperatures falling and gas prices rising, much of Europe is drifting into a perfect storm. Supply shortages, inflation, green policies and ideological opposition to Russia are creating an energy crisis.</strong></p>
    <p>As a result, power outages, stunted economic recovery and political fallout could have ramifications across the continent. In the longer term, the failure of EU policymakers will undermine energy security, make its industries less competitive, and have a negative impact on Europe&rsquo;s cohesion and role in the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Coming frost</strong></h2>
<p>Efforts by the US and EU to borrow and spend their way to recovery are failing. Growing debt and money printing are fueling inflation with a predictable impact on energy prices. America&rsquo;s recent and drastic inflation of the money supply was unnecessarily reckless, given the country was already recovering from Covid-19 lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541787-plan-green-energy-superpower/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The troubled green transition has also been a contributing factor, as the closure of nuclear power plants, an aversion to coal and the shortcomings of wind power have resulted in growing reliance on gas as a cheap and relatively clean source of energy.</p>
<p>Then there is the EU&rsquo;s decision to abandon long-term gas contracts that ensure reliable supply at predictable prices. The EU has instead favoured buying gas at spot price, in which supplies are purchased directly from what is already on the market, rather than agreeing to deliveries at a fixed price. The obvious risk, which is becoming apparent across Europe, is that gas spot prices can fluctuate fiercely and there may not be enough available product on the market, as the extraction, processing and transit of the fuel must be planned in advance.</p>
<p>Russia, which has been blamed in some quarters for the crisis, insists it is fulfilling its obligations under the existing long-term gas contracts, although it acknowledges there is not enough available gas to respond to sudden rises in demand. As a result, Moscow is replenishing its own supplies, along with supplying gas to consumers in Asia in accordance with its long-term contractual obligations, and the broader European market is too large to sufficiently boost output on such short notice.</p>
<h2><strong>Europe&rsquo;s headache</strong></h2>
<p>Relations with Russia were destined to be problematic when the West decided after the Cold War to construct a new Europe with Moscow shut out. Russia was expected to abide by the decisions of the main institutions, of which it was denied membership. To square the circle, this demanded extreme asymmetrical interdependence by increasing Russia&rsquo;s reliance on the West, while reducing the West&rsquo;s reliance on Russia. Asymmetrical economic interdependence could be converted to political power, as the worst deal presented to Russia would still be the only deal on the table.</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/business/541614-nord-stream2-gas-pipeline-delay/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Russia was excessively reliant on the West for almost everything, while Europe has to a large extent only been dependent on Russian energy. In the 1990s, Western interests were in the process of establishing control over the Russian energy market until Vladimir Putin took office and brought the vast amount back under state control. The West responded by obsessing about reducing reliance on Russian gas and seeking control over transit states, such as Ukraine where previously 80% of exports passed through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moscow aimed to use its important role as an energy provider to get a seat at the table in the institutions of Europe, while the West cautioned against the evils of the Russian <em>&ldquo;energy weapon.&rdquo;</em> Much of the West fought against additional pipelines to increase reliable gas supplies as part of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without any intended irony, the US claimed to be defending Europe&rsquo;s energy security when it placed sanctions on European companies that participated in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, over objections from Germany. The hostility to Russian gas appears to have worked, as Moscow is unlikely to construct any more pipelines to Europe, and instead will give priority to the Asian market.</p>
<p>In 2021, Europe is a different place. Russia is no longer attempting to use its position as an energy supplier to negotiate a different political set up on the continent. Instead, Moscow has abandoned its former utopian dreams of being part of a Greater Europe and has instead set its sights on the East to develop a Greater Eurasia in partnership with China. European companies, technologies and consumers are therefore becoming less and less significant for Russia&rsquo;s energy industry. Former Russian proposals for a common European security architecture and energy market have now been replaced with red lines against further NATO expansionism.</p>

<h2><strong>Is a thaw possible?</strong></h2>
<p>To resolve the energy crisis, Western Europe needs to have an honest and rational reflection regarding what has led to this perfect storm with its potential long-term implications. Instead, elites are retreating into anti-Russian sloganeering about facing a <em>&ldquo;hybrid war&rdquo;</em> and<em> &ldquo;energy weapon,&rdquo;</em> which is a comfortable distraction but fails to address the underlying problems of a continent in decline. Increased antagonism merely reaffirms Moscow&rsquo;s belief that the EU is an unreliable partner, and that Russia&rsquo;s efforts to develop new economic partnerships must remain a top priority.</p>
<p>Destined to live in a divided Europe, Brussels and Russia should make the best of it by de-politicising energy and forming a pragmatic energy partnership. Russia will behave predictably, in its own national interest, which is to act as a reliable supplier of gas in the pursuit of profitable and predictable markets. Only the EU can stop digging itself into a hole.</p>

    <p><strong>Successful vaccine rollouts have failed to stop Covid transmission, with new data showing the prevalence of the virus increasing in fully jabbed individuals, according to a medical study in The Lancet.</strong></p>
    <p>Examining new infections in Germany, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00258-1/fulltext?s=08#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers found</a> that the rate of cases among fully vaccinated individuals aged 60 and older has risen from 16.9% in July to 58.9% in October.</p>
<p>Offering a clear assessment that fully vaccinated people are increasingly becoming the source of Covid transmission, the study identified a similar situation in the UK. Throughout Britain, the number of household contacts exposed to unvaccinated cases (23%) was slightly lower than the number exposed to vaccinated individuals (25%).</p>
<p>In the space of three weeks in Britain, 100 Covid cases were reported among individuals who are 60 or older. Out of those infections, 89.7% of people were fully vaccinated, while 3.4% were unvaccinated.</p>
<p>More concerning for researchers, in Israel, an outbreak that infected multiple healthcare workers and patients, as well as their family members, came from a fully vaccinated hospital patient.</p>
<p>Backing up the fears expressed in the study, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently lists four of the five areas across the US with the highest percentage of fully vaccinated individuals as high transmission counties.</p>
<p>Researchers warned that decision makers must acknowledge the risk that is still posed by vaccinated individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The research released in The Lancet comes as countries weigh imposing Covid vaccine mandates to help protect citizens from the spread of the omicron variant and a potential resurgence in case numbers. Greece became the first nation in the EU to implement a Covid vaccine requirement, threatening all over-60s who don&rsquo;t get the jab with a monthly fine.</p>

    <p><strong>One of the women allegedly trafficked by accused Epstein ‚Äòmadam‚Äô Ghislaine Maxwell has testified to being scouted from a prestigious music camp and groomed with ‚Äòscholarships‚Äô as her family was in financial need.</strong></p>
    <p>The woman, testifying under the pseudonym &lsquo;Jane&rsquo;, described the grooming process during testimony on Tuesday, from being spotted at the prestigious Interlochen music camp in Michigan to being chatted up by Maxwell and Epstein. Their apparent concern for her near-bankrupt family&rsquo;s financial situation following the death of her father from leukemia was welcome at a fragile time in her life.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541689-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-opening-statements/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>Jane testified that the pair&rsquo;s mention of &ldquo;<em>scholarships</em>&rdquo; was appealing, and she ultimately gave them her mother&rsquo;s phone number, which led to invites for the teen to &ldquo;<em>tea</em>&rdquo; at Epstein&rsquo;s home. There, Jane said she spent time &ldquo;<em>every week or two</em>&rdquo; &ndash; starting with &ldquo;<em>casual stuff</em>&rdquo; like shopping sprees and mall dates.</p>
<p>But things escalated quickly, Jane told the court, mentioning &ldquo;<em>odd incidents</em>&rdquo; like stepping out to the pool to find a bevy of topless and nude women, including Ghislaine. &ldquo;<em>I was just shocked because I hadn&rsquo;t seen that before</em>,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Jane says she was first abused by Epstein at his Palm Beach home as he promised to help with her artistic career. He &ldquo;<em>knew all the agents &hellip; all the photographers &hellip; and could &lsquo;make things happen,&rsquo;</em>&rdquo; he allegedly told her.</p>
<p>Epstein &ldquo;<em>took me in the pool house and on the right-hand side was this couch, futon-looking thing, and he just proceeded to pull me over. He sat in the corner and didn&rsquo;t say a word</em>,&rdquo; she testified. Jane said Epstein then pulled his pants down, &ldquo;<em>pulled me on top of himself, and proceeded to masturbate on me.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>"I was frozen in fear. I&rsquo;d never seen a penis before&hellip; There were hands everywhere,"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Jane, who was 14 when she first met Epstein and Maxwell, claimed such sexual encounters would occur &ldquo;<em>about every two weeks</em>,&rdquo; with Maxwell allegedly touching her breasts during group sex.</p>
<p>The accused faces six charges of allegedly conspiring with Epstein and assisting in his abuse of underage girls between 1994 and 2004. If convicted, she may spend as much as 80 years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty on all charges.</p>

<p>He is being held without bond and is expected to appear in court on December 22, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/32755740/father-charged-shooting-death-ex-ucf-knights-rb-otis-anderson-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>The disagreement allegedly broke out after the elder Anderson was bitten by his son's girlfriend's dog, according to <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/former-ucf-nfl-player-shot-and-killed-by-own-father-in-north-florida/2631173/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NBC's</a>&nbsp;account of the arrest report.</p>
<p>Father and son then got into a heated verbal disagreement, which caused his mother to advise Otis Jr to go upstairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As husband and wife also started arguing, Jr&nbsp;returned to the downstairs area of the property to check on his mother when he heard his father overturn a recliner.</p>
<p>Anderson Jr is said to have suffered gunshot wounds to his chest and back after he and his father began rowing a final time.</p>
<p>In a tribute tweet, the University of Tennessee's head coach, Josh Heupel, who led Anderson at UCF, revealed he was <em>"saddened and stunned"</em> by his former player's death.</p>

<p><em>"Tough and gritty, fun and full of laughter, he made such a positive impact on our university, community, and our locker room,"</em> added Heupel.&nbsp;<em>"He was an unbelievable teammate."</em></p>
<p>The UCF, which has had flowers and jerseys laid out on its football field, said Anderson Jr was <em>"forever a Knight"</em> and&nbsp;<em>"revered by his teammates, our fans, and everyone within Knight Nation"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Our deepest condolences go out to everyone who loved Otis. He was taken too soon and will truly be missed,"</em> the college added.</p>
<p>Anderson Jr&nbsp;spent&nbsp;four years&nbsp;with the Knights, scoring 26 touchdowns while notching up 3,200 total yards before going on to the Los Angeles Rams training camp. He was cut in September.</p>
<p>The NFL franchise described Anderson Jr as a&nbsp;<em>"promising young man with a bright future"</em> and offered their condolences to the family.</p>

    <p><strong>If Belarus recognizes the disputed Crimean Peninsula as part of Russia, Minsk will deal an ‚Äúirreparable blow‚Äù to its relationship with Ukraine, Kiev‚Äôs Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba warned on Wednesday.</strong></p>
    <p>Speaking to the press in Latvia, where a meeting of NATO foreign ministers is taking place, Kuleba reacted to news that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was planning a trip to Crimea. This would essentially mean that Belarus would become one of a handful of nations to recognize the peninsula as Russian.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will assess [Lukashenko&rsquo;s] actions,&rdquo;</em> Kuleba told the press. <em>&ldquo;If Belarus recognizes Russia&rsquo;s illegal occupation of Crimea, this will deal an irreparable blow to Ukrainian-Belarusian relations.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541451-kuleba-ukraine-war-readiness/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p><em>&ldquo;We will act in full force. Crimea is not an issue where we can abstain,</em>&rdquo; Kuleba continued.</p>
<p>Crimea was re-absorbed into Russia in March 2014, following a referendum. That vote is unrecognized by Ukraine and most of the world, which views the peninsula as illegally occupied by Moscow and the referendum illegitimate.</p>
<p>That same month, a vote in the United Nations General Assembly saw 100 nations support the <em>&ldquo;territorial integrity of Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> while 11 were against the motion. Those were Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. Abstaining were 58 members.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lukashenko said he intends to visit Crimea, together with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] promised me that he would bring me along to Crimea to showcase novelties there, to show what new has been done there,&rdquo;</em> Lukashenko said.</p>

    <p><strong>An NHL hockey star has been punished for biting another player ‚Äì with "circumstantial evidence" said to suggest that he chomped down on his rival more than once during the match.</strong></p>
    <p>Brendan Lemieux, who plays for the Los Angeles Kings, has been hit with a five-game ban and a fine for gnawing on Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk's hand during a match.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at&nbsp;13:51 in the third period of the meeting that finished 4-2 to the Kings, as the pair &ndash; sons of NHL legends Claude Lemieux and Keith Tkachuk &ndash;&nbsp;took part in a brawl.</p>
<p>As Tkachuk showed referees his bare bitten hand, Lemieux was hit with a match penalty and ejected.</p>

<p>Some viewers accused Lemieux of biting Tkachuk more than once, with one hockey writer reporting that the findings from the Zoom hearing had not dismissed that theory.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;While circumstantial evidence supports the argument that Lemieux may have bitten Tkachuk multiple times during this fight, we are limiting our review of this incident to the bite that occurs almost immediately after the players fall to the ice,"</em> he quoted the findings as saying.</p>
<p>The NHL's Department of Player Safety has offered Lemieux an in-person hearing, leading some&nbsp;to conclude that an even bigger suspension could be on the horizon.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-2"><em>"While on the ice, Lemieux, feeling Tkachuk's hands on his face as they wrestle, bites Tkachuk on his bare left hand and does so with a substantial amount of force," </em>it said in a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/video/lemieux-suspended-five-games/t-277440360/c-9721511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Tkachuk was critical of Lemieux following their bust-up and branded his act&nbsp;<em>"the most gutless thing somebody could ever do"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Nobody ever wants to play with [him]"</em>, he added, before calling his foe a <em>"bad guy and a bad teammate"</em>, a <em>"complete brickhead"</em>, and an <em>"absolute joke"</em>.</p>
<p>Rushing to Lemieux's defense, though, was goaltender Jonathan Quick, who said to the King's manager of editorial content Zach Dooley: <em>"I have my own opinion about what happened or did not happen... and what I can tell you is that any comments that were made about [Lemieux] were garbage."</em></p>
<p><em>"He's a valuable player who sticks up for his teammates. We all support him, and I'd rather have him on my team over that kid any day of the week."</em></p>

<p><em>"He&rsquo;s got a team full of supporters today that are happy he&rsquo;s a part of the group and he does his job and he does it very well."</em></p>
<p>After serving his suspension, Lemieux, who will forfeit&nbsp;forfeit $38,750, is expected to return to action against the Minnesota Wild on December 11.</p>

        <h1>Trump denies he had Covid during Biden debate</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T16:14:52+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 16:14</time>

    <p><strong>Former US President Donald Trump has denied a claim by his last chief of staff, Mark Meadows, that he had tested positive for Covid-19 three days before his first presidential debate against Joe Biden.</strong></p>
    <p>On Wednesday, former US President Donald Trump rubbished a claim that he had attended a presidential debate despite having tested positive for Covid-19 within the previous 72 hours.<em> &ldquo;The story of me having Covid prior to, or during, the first debate is fake news,&rdquo;</em> the 75-year-old <a href="https://twitter.com/margommartin/status/1466046708043894785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in a statement shared by his deputy director of communications, Margo Martin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In fact, a test revealed that I did not have Covid-19 prior to the debate,&rdquo;</em> he added. The event in question took place on September 29, 2020. On October 2, Trump announced that he had Covid-19. Later that day he was taken to hospital for treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former president&rsquo;s statement comes in response to a bombshell claim made in the soon-to-be-released memoir of Trump&rsquo;s fourth and final chief of staff, Mark Meadows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541889-harvard-poll-civil-war-democracy/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>In the memoirs, as seen by The Guardian, Meadows claims that his boss attended a presidential debate despite having tested positive for Covid-19 three days before. The former chief of staff states that Trump returned a negative result from a different test shortly after the positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meadows writes that as Marine One lifted off to travel to a rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania on September 26, White House doctor Sean Conley called saying the president had tested positive for Covid and therefore must not fly. However, it was too late to stop him from leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some bad news. You&rsquo;ve tested positive for Covid-19,&rdquo;</em> Meadows told Trump, now on Air Force One. Trump, who had the appearance of someone suffering from a <em>&ldquo;light cold,&rdquo;</em> responded with dismay. Meadows, a devout Christian, quoted the then-president as saying something that rhymes with, <em>&ldquo;Oh spit, you&rsquo;ve gotta be trucking lidding me.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The chief of staff explained to the president that the test had been done with an old model kit and said they would repeat the test with <em>&ldquo;the Binax system,&rdquo;</em> in the hope that it was a false positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a tense wait, Meadows called back with news of a negative test. He claims Trump took that call as <em>&ldquo;full permission to press on as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the memoirs, Trump knew he had to test negative within 72 hours of the debate starting, but nothing was going to stop him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Cleveland debate with 77-year-old Joe Biden went ahead on September 29, the second debate, scheduled for October 15, was cancelled after Trump&rsquo;s battle with Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>The mother of a "perfect" college student who died in a charity boxing match days before his 21st birthday has revealed that her son had never fought before and alleged that the bout referee and judges were seen drinking.</strong></p>
    <p>University of Las Vegas student Nathan Valencia, 20, died four days after appearing at an event raising money for a youth boxing club.</p>
<p>Although the coroner has&nbsp;classified Valencia's death as a homicide by blunt force trauma to the head,&nbsp;his family's attorneys have said that they will<em> "leave no stone unturned to determine how a 20-year-old ended up in a school-sanctioned amateur fight that cost him his life."</em></p>
<p><em>"I kept asking him: 'are you going to be protected or are you going to be wearing headgear?'"</em> Valencia's mother, Cynthia, told CNN.<em> "He said, 'of course, this is for charity'."&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>University&nbsp;President Keith E Whitfield emphasized that the match was held off-campus and said that his institution was<em>&nbsp;"shocked and heartbroken as we mourn the loss of one of our own".</em></p>
<p><em>"Our deepest sympathies go out to his family, friends and loved ones. I am sure words cannot describe their feeling of grief and emptiness,"</em> Whitfield said. "<em>They are in our thoughts during this very difficult time."</em></p>
<p>Valencia's mother added in her interview:<em>&nbsp;"To me, he was perfect. He was god's greatest gift to us.</em></p>
<p><em>"Everyone was drawn to him.&nbsp;</em><em>He loved life. He lost his life so tragically &ndash; it could have been avoided."</em></p>

        <h1>French presidential candidate accused of ‚Äòpiracy‚Äô</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T15:44:53+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 15:44</time>

    <p><strong>Media outlets, celebrities, and film production companies have expressed outrage over the unauthorized use of their images in a campaign video by far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.</strong></p>
    <p>The 63-year-old announced his bid for the presidency on Tuesday in a video that featured him speaking over footage of women in headscarves and black men engaging in civil disobedience.</p>
<p>The right-wing pundit and author said he wanted to &ldquo;<em>save</em>&rdquo; France from minorities that &ldquo;<em>oppress the majority</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <figure class="op-interactive">
        
                    <div class="media__youtube">        <iframe class="media__youtube-frame" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8IGBDK1BH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>            </figure>


<p>Movie production company Gaumot quickly accused him of using its content<strong data-stringify-type="bold">&nbsp;</strong>without permission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gaumont was surprised to discover that clips of the films from its catalogue have been included into Eric Zemmour&rsquo;s campaign video without any authorization.&nbsp;Gaumont reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings</em>,&rdquo; read the statement by the company, which owns the rights for Luc Besson&rsquo;s Joan of Arc movie and Henri Verneuil&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Monkey In Winter&rsquo;, both featured in Zemmour&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>Besson also expressed his fury, telling AFP the images were used &ldquo;<em>in a fraudulent manner</em>&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;<em>shares none of Eric Zemmour&rsquo;s ideas</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his 10-minute-long video, Zemmour warned of the &ldquo;<em>tragic fate</em>&rdquo; facing the traditional and once-great France, saying it was disappearing due to an influx of migrants and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>France Televisions, the National Audiovisual Institute, and Radio France in a joint statement claimed they never gave Zemmour permission to use their images and that the presidential hopeful should pay for the right to use them &ldquo;<em>like everyone else</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541770-france-zemmour-macron-president/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>France 24 said it would demand the immediate removal of its footage and would be prepared, if necessary, to use legal means.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the owner of a chateau featured in the campaign video, Casimir de Blacas, labeled the use of images of his &ldquo;<em>family home</em>&rdquo; as &ldquo;<em>piracy, pure and simple</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When approached by AFP, Zemmour&rsquo;s team said they had enjoyed their right to use &ldquo;<em>short quotes</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, a lawyer for France&rsquo;s copyright watchdog, SCAM, told the agency this was not the case and that brief extracts could not be used for promotional purposes.</p>

        <h1>Young Americans see US democracy as failed ‚Äì poll</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T15:26:27+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 15:26</time>

    <p><strong>A national survey of 18-to 29-year-old Americans shows more than half believe US democracy has either ‚Äúfailed‚Äù or is ‚Äúin trouble,‚Äù and a significant portion also sees the potential for civil war.</strong></p>
    <p>Of the 52% polled who said they&rsquo;ve lost or are losing faith in America&rsquo;s democratic system, 39% described the country as a <em>&ldquo;democracy in trouble.&rdquo;</em> Another 13% of respondents called it a <em>&ldquo;failed democracy,&rdquo;</em> according to research released on Wednesday by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
<p>Of the more than 2,100 young Americans surveyed for the poll, only 7% said they believe the US is a <em>&ldquo;healthy democracy,&rdquo;</em> while another 27% consider it a <em>&ldquo;somewhat functioning democracy.&rdquo;</em></p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">

    </ul>


<p>Unsurprisingly, those who identified as Republicans were the most concerned about the state of the US under the leadership of Joe Biden &ndash; a Democrat with sinking poll numbers as he attempts to address numerous crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, and record inflation.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s approval numbers among young voters in the Harvard poll represented declines similar to other recent surveys. Only 46% of respondents to this survey said they approved of the president&rsquo;s job performance &ndash; a 13% drop from a similar poll that was taken by the group in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Democrats expressed the most faith in the country, 45% said the US is either a democracy in trouble or one too far gone. Only 11% of those self-identified Democrats called the US a <em>&ldquo;healthy democracy&rdquo;</em> in the poll. Meanwhile, over half of Republicans and independents agreed that the US has failed or is in trouble, with 70% saying they held a negative view of the state of the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In perhaps the polling&rsquo;s most startling findings, 35% of the young Americans surveyed said they saw the potential for a second civil war in their lifetimes, while a quarter of those polled believed they could see a US state secede within their lifetime.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Armed police storm homes over social media comments (VIDEO)</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T15:12:01+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 15:12</time>

    <p><strong>Officers in Belarus have arrested eleven people accused of making offensive comments about the deaths of Russian paratroopers in a training accident earlier this month, Minsk's Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on Wednesday.</strong></p>
    <p>Video of one of the arrests shows a group of at least four special forces members entering an apartment in the capital armed with rifles and military gear. They shine their flashlights through the doorway at the eventual detainee, an IT worker caught seemingly by surprise.</p>
    

<p>According to the Belarusian authorities, the 11 people arrested had made comments on social media joking about the deaths. The soldiers had been conducting joint exercises with the Belarusian armed forces.</p>
<p>They also said that many of them were subscribed to <em>&ldquo;extremist Telegram channels,&rdquo;</em> referring to the messaging app. The Belarusian government has deemed almost all major opposition news outlets to be against the law in the wake of the protests that followed last year&rsquo;s disputed presidential election.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/541771-belarus-invite-nuclear-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">READ MORE:&nbsp;Belarus may invite Russian nuclear weapons into country</a></strong></p>
<p>Officials added that they had found more than 50 people who had made <em>&ldquo;blasphemous and insulting&rdquo;</em> comments about the tragedy on social media. Those arrested could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>On November 12, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the deaths of the two paratroopers during joint training with Belarusian forces in the city of Grodno, in western Belarus. The Ministry said the tragic accident happened because of a <em>&ldquo;sudden strong wind&rdquo;</em> and that one had tried to save his comrade using his reserve parachute.</p>

        <h1>US Navy ponders cutting training flight hours</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T14:53:51+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 14:53</time>

    <p><strong>Allowing pilots to use simulators more instead of actual flights would be an efficient way to cut expenses during training, a senior US naval commander has said.</strong></p>
    <p>The military is determined to reduce the <em>&ldquo;pretty staggering&rdquo;</em> cost per flight hour to train pilots, Rear Admiral John Meier, the commander of Naval Air Force Atlantic, said at the annual Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday, as quoted by Defense News.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;One of the areas that I&rsquo;ve got a laser dot on is how can we reduce some of that flying hours and increase more on the simulation side,&rdquo;</em> Meier said.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/541167-pentagon-ufo-task-creation/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p><em>&ldquo;The current balance of flights to simulation today is heavily skewed in flights for most aircraft,&rdquo;</em> he continued, adding that replacing some of the flights with training via simulation events in classrooms <em>&ldquo;would be a step in the right direction.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meier said simulator hours should not make up more than a quarter of total training time. He noted that the training to fly newer aircraft, such as the F-35 Joint Strike fighter and the P-8A Poseidon patrol plane, relies more heavily on simulations. Training to fly older aircraft, such as the F/A-18E-F Super Hornet, which makes up the bulk of the Navy&rsquo;s fighter fleet, requires more live flying hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meier told Defense News that existing technology allows for a shift toward more simulations without sacrificing the quality of training. He added that the change would let pilots focus more on <em>&ldquo;high-end tactics,&rdquo;</em> rather than on basic maneuvers.</p>
<p>The commandant of the US Marine Corps, General David Berger, said at the same event that the armed forces need modeling and simulation software&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;replicates the adversary, whether it&rsquo;s Russia&nbsp;or<strong data-stringify-type="bold">&nbsp;</strong>Iran&rdquo;</em> or others.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We envision our adversary&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;and operating and fighting like we would, which is a big mistake,&rdquo;</em> he said.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Antibody neutralizing all Covid variants found, Chinese scientists claim</h1>

                <time class="op-published" datetime="2021-12-01T14:49:14+00:00">1 Dec, 2021 14:49</time>

    <p><strong>Chinese scientists claim to have isolated an antibody which can effectively neutralize all strains of Covid-19, referencing both lab experiments and those performed on a living organism.</strong></p>
    <p>In a study <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.29.470356v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> on Tuesday, Chinese scientists from a variety of institutions, including Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, suggested that they may have the panacea to the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
        
    <ul class="op-related-articles" title="Read more">
        <li><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/541861-eu-chief-think-mandatory-vaccination/"></a></li>
    </ul>


<p>The authors claim that monoclonal antibody 35B5 has been shown in both in vitro (laboratory or test-tube experiment) and in vivo (performed on living organism) studies to neutralize wild-type Covid-19 (without mutations) as well as variants of concern (VOCs). The in vivo tests were carried out on humanized mice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scientists noted that the antibody also works on the highly mutated Delta variant, which has been responsible for deadly waves of infection around the world since it first emerged in India earlier this year.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;35B5 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] by targeting a unique epitope [part of the antigen molecule which the antibody attaches itself to] that avoids the prevailing mutation sites,&rdquo;</em> the study explains. In other words, 35B5 targets a unique part of the virus that does not change during the mutation process.</p>
<p>By targeting part of the virus which is not impacted by the mutations identified in circulating VOCs, antibody 35B5 demonstrated capacity for <em>&ldquo;pan-neutralizing efficacy&rdquo;</em> across multiple strains. These findings, the scientists argue, could be <em>&ldquo;exploited for the rational design of a universal SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] vaccine.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The part of the antigen targeted by antibody 35B5 is also present in the Omicron variant, the researchers note.</p>
<p>The research could prove particularly valuable amid the spread of Omicron, which is highly mutated. Leaders and scientists around the world are concerned the mutant virus could evade vaccine-induced immunity and immunity gained from previous infection.&nbsp;</p>
